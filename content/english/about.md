# Welcome to Day 1

Welcome to **[day1hpc.com](http://day1hpc.com/)** - a community site built and curated by the **Developer Relations team in HPC Engineering at AWS**. Our job is to be the interface between our HPC engineering teams and the people in the HPC community who want to use AWS to create ***powerful*** tools for solving ***hard*** problems.

To do that, we'll spend a lot of our time explaining how these services work, and getting your feedback so we can improve them, continuously. You’ll find a lot of things on this site to help you understand AWS a little better, all with the aim of getting you where to want to go, faster.

If you see us at a conference, please say ‘hi’ and let us know how we can help.

You can find us on Twitter at [@TechHpc](https://twitter.com/TechHpc), on YouTube in the [HPC Tech Shorts Channel](https://hpc.news/techshorts), or blogging to the world from the [AWS HPC Blog Channel](https://hpc.news/blog). Please reach out and let us know what you’re finding hard, or easy.
