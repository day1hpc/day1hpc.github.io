# About Page

Welcome to [day1hpc.com](http://day1hpc.com/) - a community site built and curated by the **Developer Relations team in HPC Engineering at AWS**. Our mission is to be the interface between our HPC engineering teams and people in the HPC community who want to use AWS to create ***powerful*** tools for solving ***hard*** problems.

Over time, you’ll find a lot of things on this site to help you understand AWS a little better and to hopefully propel you to where to want to go, faster.

If you see us at a conference, please say ‘hi’. We crave for feedback to help us know where we can spend some effort to make your life a little easier.

You can find us on Twitter at [@TechHpc](https://twitter.com/TechHpc), on YouTube in the [HPC Tech Shorts Channel](https://hpc.news/techshorts), or blogging to the world from the [AWS HPC Blog Channel](https://hpc.news/blog). Please reach out and let us know what you’re finding hard, or easy.
