# AWS Batch
**AWS Batch** is an always-on scheduler that lets you easily and efficiently run thousands of container jobs.
**Workflow builders** love it for scaling their workloads, from machine learning to genomics. It scales from **one job to millions** and takes away the chore of spinning up fleets of compute instances and keeping them busy.
