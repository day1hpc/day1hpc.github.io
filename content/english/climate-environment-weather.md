## Learn about climate, environment, and weather on AWS HPC

Weather simulation is a reliably difficult workload for almost any HPC architecture and is often used as a litmus test by many customers before they look at a novel technologies or different systems. Customers have asked us frequently about our performance, and thatâ€™s been even more the case since we launched the [Elastic Fabric  Adapter](/efa/) and several new HPC-oriented instance families.

The Hpc6a is built on AMD's Milan, and the [AWS Graviton](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/) is our Arm64-based processor. Both perform excellently with a variety of weather and climate codes, as you can see in the blog posts, videos and discussions linked on this page.

**[These workshops](https://weather.hpcworkshops.com/)** lead you through getting started with AWS ParallelCluster including installation and use of WRF, MPAS, and Unified Forecase System FV3GFS. **[(Workshop)](https://weather.hpcworkshops.com/)**

You can work through them in your own AWS account, or use them in a class-room scenario for a group.
