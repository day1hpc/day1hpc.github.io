# AWS ParallelCluster
ParallelCluster is a tool for creating and managing **HPC clusters on AWS,** whether they're powered by x86 CPUs, AWS Gravitons (our Arm-based processors), or powerful GPUs for machine-learning applications.

ParallelCluster brings together advanced **compute, storage and networking** into a *single console*. It adds great features like **desktop visualization** (with [NICE DCV](/dcv)) for any cluster, and [integrates deeply with Slurm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/schedulers.slurm.html) to provide cloud-native scaling for all your applications.

ParallelCluster has a graphical interface (and a CLI) to model and control all the resources you need for your HPC applications, and an API you can use for sophisticated management of workflows.

## Deployment

There are two ways to get ParallelCluster::

1. **We suggest using [PCluster Manager](https://pcluster.cloud/01-getting-started.html)**, which is a visual interface for designing and deploying your clusters. **PCluster Manager** has great features that help you integrate fast filesytems (like Lustre), get one-click desktops connections using NICE DCV, and **controlling your spend** using Slurm Accounting. PCluster Manager can be deployed to your AWS account very quickly, by following the tutorial [here](https://pcluster.cloud/01-getting-started.html).

2. If you're familiar with AWS already, and just want the CLI, you can install it on almost any computer with python installed. The procedure is [documented here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/install-v3-parallelcluster.html), but pretty much starts with:

``` bash
$ pip3 install "aws-parallelcluster<3.0" --upgrade --user
```

## Learning about ParallelCluster

First, you should make sure you're comfortable that ParallelCluster is the right path for your workloads in AWS. There's a great blog post which helps to explain **[the difference between AWS Batch or AWS ParallelCluster](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/hpc/choosing-between-batch-or-parallelcluster-for-hpc/)**.

## Scheduler Migration

{{< image src="/images/hpc/media-ident-square.png" class="boof" >}}

**Migrating between schedulers** doesn't need to be hard. Since SGE is no longer supported by the community, we worked with the team at [SchedMD](https://www.schedmd.com/) to create a tutorial series to help everyone understand what tools are available in Slurm, to make the shift easier.

There's a blog post with several cheat sheets, and a Tech Shorts series in 4-parts so you can find exactly what you want.

## Use cases

ParallelCluster delivers you a canonical Beowulf cluster experience on AWS, but with added twists like elasticity, and support for fast storage and networking, built-in *by design*. That means you can run virtually any workload you like on AWS and expect to see great results.

The tabs here have videos and blog posts describing different use-cases for ParallelCluster.
