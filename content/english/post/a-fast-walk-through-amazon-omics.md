If you've ever had to stand up a rig on premises or in the cloud to run genomics pipelines, or do downstream analysis, you'll know it's not a small pile of packages you need to build, and connecting them all can be ... well, messy. We built Amazon Omics to make this easier.

Lee Pang from the Genomics AI service team here in AWS engineering, swung by Tech Shorts to give us the cook's tour of this very cool, and very important, kitchen.

If you have ideas for technical topics you'd like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by finding us on Twitter (@TechHpc) and DM'ing us with your idea.
