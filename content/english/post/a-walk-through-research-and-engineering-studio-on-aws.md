Research and Engineering Studio on AWS (RES) is a new product from the HPC team at AWS built for scientists and engineering users who just want to get on with doing their R&D work, without having to know the fiddly details of launching cloud instances to work with their compute.

In this show, we'll walk you through the current version (2024.03) and give you a cook's tour of the interface, and an explaination of the basic concepts RES works on, so you can figure out if it's for you. 

If you have ideas for technical topics you'd like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by emailing us at ask-hpc@amazon.com.
