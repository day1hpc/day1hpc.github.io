Fair share scheduling sounds good (and it *is* good), but it's sometimes hard to visualize how it's going to help you, and what it'll do to your job queues. Exactly *how* is it fair?

Angel Pizarro, our Principal Dev Advocate for Batch, joins us to work through a very clear example with jobs flowing, and helps to explain exactly what the config variables in FSS do with your queues. It seriously doesn't get clearer than this.
