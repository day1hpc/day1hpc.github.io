# Welcome to Day 1

Welcome to **[day1hpc.com](http://day1hpc.com/)** - a community site built and curated by the **Developer Relations team in HPC Engineering at AWS**. Our job is to be the interface between our HPC engineering teams and the people in the HPC community who want to use AWS to create ***powerful*** tools for solving ***hard*** problems.

To do that, we'll spend a lot of our time explaining how these services work, and getting your feedback so we can improve them, continuously. You’ll find a lot of things on this site to help you understand AWS a little better, all with the aim of getting you where to want to go, faster.

## We called the site Day1Hpc for a couple of reasons.

**One** is to pay homage to [our employer](https://aws.amazon.com/executive-insights/content/how-amazon-defines-and-operationalizes-a-day-1-culture/) (Amazon Web Services) where Day 1 means *"focusing on customers, creating long term value over short-term corporate profit, and making many bold bets"*. It's the patient capital (human and otherwise) that has allowed us to experiment with a lot of ideas for solving problems in different ways.

**The other reason** is that *it's still Day 1 for HPC in the cloud*. We see endless possibilities to improve the productivity of every scientist or engineer who uses HPC as a tool in their exploration. And we're optimistic about where that's going to lead us all.

If you see any of us at a conference, please say ‘hi’ and let us know how we can help.

You can find us on Twitter at **[@TechHpc](https://twitter.com/TechHpc)**, on YouTube in the **[HPC Tech Shorts Channel](https://hpc.news/techshorts)**, or blogging to the world from the **[AWS HPC Blog Channel](https://hpc.news/blog)**. Please reach out and let us know what you’re finding hard, or easy.
