In 2021, Amazon Braket, the fully-managed quantum computing service from AWS, launched Amazon Braket Hybrid Jobs to provide customers a convenient way to run hybrid algorithms without worrying about managing the underlying infrastructure. With features such as priority access to quantum processing units (QPUs), Amazon Braket Hybrid Jobs is designed for lower latency and faster […]
