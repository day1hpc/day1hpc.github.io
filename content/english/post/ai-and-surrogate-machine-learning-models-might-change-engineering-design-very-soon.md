Do you wish you could get CFD results for your latest design iteration in seconds rather than days?

Work on new machine-learning techniques might take your CFD simulations from days down to seconds. Today, we discuss an open collaborative research project that trained ML models on hundreds of automotive designs. 

After training, these models can predict detailed flow fields and forces near instantaneously, with quite acceptable results. For designers and engineers, this means the ability to evaluate more options and refine designs in a fraction of the time.

Discover how AI and HPC are merging to create this new paradigm in computational engineering. See how machine learning can enhance your research or design work. The future of simulation is on the way.
