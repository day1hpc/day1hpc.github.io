Drug discovery is an expensive proposition, with a $2.6 billion cost over 10 years and just a 12% success rate. AI promises to significantly improve the success rate by finding small molecule hits for undruggable targets. On the forefront of using AI in drug discovery is Atomwise, with its AtomNetÂ® platform. In this blog, we will lay out the challenges of the drug discovery process, and show how AI/ML startups are solving these challenges using solutions from Atomwise, AWS, and WEKA.
