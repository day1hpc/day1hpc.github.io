When experimenting on a quantum computer, customers often need to program at the lower-level language of the device. Today, we are launching Braket Pulse, a feature that provides pulse-level access to quantum processing units (QPUs) from two hardware providers on Amazon Braket, Rigetti Computing and Oxford Quantum Circuits (OQC). In this blog, we present an [â€¦]
