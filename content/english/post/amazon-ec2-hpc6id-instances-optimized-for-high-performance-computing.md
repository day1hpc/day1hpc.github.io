description: "Today, we announce the general availability of Amazon EC2 Hpc6id instances, a new instance type that is purpose-built for tightly coupled HPC workloads. Amazon EC2 Hpc6id instances are powered by 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors (Ice Lake) that run at frequencies up to 3.5 GHz, 1024 GiB memory, 15.2 TB local SSD disk, 200 Gbps Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) network bandwidth, which is 4x higher than R6i instances."

Today, we announce the general availability of Amazon EC2 Hpc6id instances, a new instance type that is purpose-built for tightly coupled HPC workloads. Amazon EC2 Hpc6id instances are powered by 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors (Ice Lake) that run at frequencies up to 3.5 GHz, 1024 GiB memory, 15.2 TB local SSD disk, 200 Gbps Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) network bandwidth, which is 4x higher than R6i instances. Amazon EC2 Hpc6id instances have the best per-vCPU HPC performance when compared to similar x86-based EC2 instances for data-intensive HPC workloads.
