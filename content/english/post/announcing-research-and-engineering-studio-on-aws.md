In research and development, visualization is important - so why is it so hard to set up a visual desktop? Customers told us it needed to be easier, better managed, and generally safer for their users... and their data.

So today we're launching a new, fully-supported, open-source product called  'Research and Engineering Studio on AWS', or just RES.

Our product managers for RES, Bala and Emily, swung by Tech Shorts to explain it.

You can get the scoop from our blog post (https://hpc.news/res101)

We'd love to know what you think,
