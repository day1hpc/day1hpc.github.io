Genomics community: rejoice! Seqera + AWS have teamed up to announce Seqera Containers, an open-source, no cost, reliable way to generate containers (on the fly if you wish) for your workflows – in the cloud or not, using Nextflow, or not. This is a global community resource we’re thrilled to be able to support.
