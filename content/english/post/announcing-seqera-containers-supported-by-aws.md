Are you a bioinformatician looking for an easier way to build and access Docker containers? Check out this video to learn about Seqera Containers, a new community service that takes the friction out of using containers in your workflows.

Seqera Containers allows you to almost instantly build custom Docker and Singularity containers on-demand from Bioconda, PyPI, and Conda packages. It handles caching and long-term storage so you can reliably reproduce your work.

Whether you use Nextflow, run on HPC or cloud infrastructure, or want to enable ARM64 support, this has you covered. Eliminate container build headaches and focus on your science - learn how Seqera Containers can simplify your life in this demo from Phil Ewels.

If you have ideas for technical topics you'd like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by emailing us at ask-hpc@amazon.com.
