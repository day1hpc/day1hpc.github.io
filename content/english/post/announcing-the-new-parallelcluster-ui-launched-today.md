AWS ParallelCluster has a new UI for designing, deploying, and managing clusters on AWS. It's packed with all the features you'd imagine, and is built to ensure you spend more time designing your clusters to suit your workloads and no time at all wrestling with YAML files or manually tweaking cluster operations.

Nikita Buldakov and Matt Vaughn stopped by the Tech Shorts studio to show us how it works and take us for a drive.

AWS ParallelCluster UI is now generally available, starting with ParallelCluster 3.5. The details are all in our docs at http://hpc.news/oneclickPCUI and it only take a couple of minutes to install.

If you have ideas for technical topics you'd like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by finding us on Twitter (@TechHpc) and DM'ing us with your idea.
