In this post, we will discuss the current landscape of quantum benchmarking and introduce SupermarQ, Super.tech’s suite of application-based benchmarks designed to overcome the limitations of existing approaches. SupermarQ uses Amazon Braket for device-agnostic access to gate-based quantum processing units (QPUs), so benchmarks can highlight the heterogeneity of quantum computers and their various strengths in […]
