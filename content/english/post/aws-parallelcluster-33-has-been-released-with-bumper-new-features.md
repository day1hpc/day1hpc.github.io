We just released version 3.3 of  AWS ParallelCluster, and it has a whole bag of new features.

* instance type allocation diversity in your queues;
* separation of shred volumes from the cluster lifecycle
* SLURM ACCOUNTING (this is pretty popular)
* support for ODCRs (a 70's progressive rock band ^H^H^H^H^H a way of reserving capacity despite ParallelCluster's best efforts to reduce your unnecessary usage - it's honestly needed at times).

Matt Vaughn - our WW Principal Dev Advocate for HPC (@yakshavers) came to Tech Shorts to explain it all to us.
