Today, we are introducing Palace, for PArallel, LArge-scale Computational Electromagnetics, a parallel finite element code for full-wave electromagnetics simulations. Palace is used at the AWS Center for Quantum Computing to perform large-scale 3D simulations of complex electromagnetics models and enable the design of quantum computing hardware. We developed it with support for the scalability and [â€¦]
