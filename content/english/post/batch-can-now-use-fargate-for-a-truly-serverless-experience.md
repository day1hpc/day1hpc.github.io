Now that AWS Batch supports AWS Fargate, you can submit jobs any time you like, and AWS just spins up the resources you need when you need them, REALLY quickly (because that's what Fargate is awesome at). You don't need to keep any resources running other than precisely the ones you need right now, and you get results right away. No managing servers, or even worrying about them. That's why it's serverless :-)

Our Principal Product Manager for AWS Batch, Steve Kendrex, explains how it all works and walks us through a live example.

During the talk, we mentioned this page for more information on using Batch with Fargate, and that page is here: https://aws.amazon.com/batch/features/?nc=sn&loc=2
