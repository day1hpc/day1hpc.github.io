Your pension fund is probably looked after by a company a lot like CFM. They use large scale, real-time analytics to help them shift their position on the financial markets to control the risk they - and their investors (like all of us) - are exposed to. It's critical stuff if you want to retire happily one day.

Today, with the help of our HPC & AI partner, ANEO,  we'll get a fascinating look behind the scenes at how they use cutting-edge data science - and some really weird HCP architectures - to run their business safely.

You'll see how they built a really robust cloud architecture to run large-scale analytics, enabling their fund managers to focus on market signals rather than IT operations.

And you'll see how they achieved scalability for their existing workflows, without sacrificing stability. Whether you're an aspiring quant or just investment-curious, this video gives a fascinating look at how 'quants' use data science to gain an edge in fast-moving markets.
