Introduction In recent years, quantum computers have evolved from laboratory experiments available to only a handful of scientists, to research devices that are accessible worldwide through cloud services like Amazon Braket. The impact of cloud access to quantum computers is not limited to laboratory scientists and developers as it allows educators to bring these devices [â€¦]
