If you run molecular dynamics simulations, you need to read this. We walk through running benchmarks of popular apps like GROMACS and LAMMPS on new Hpc7g instances and Graviton3E processors. The results â€“ up to 35% better vector performance versus Graviton3! Learn how to optimize your own workflows.
