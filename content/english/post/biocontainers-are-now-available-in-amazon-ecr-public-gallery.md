Today we are excited to announce that all 9000+ applications provided by the BioContainers community are available within ECR Public Gallery! You donâ€™t need an AWS account to access these images, but having one allows many more pulls to the internet, and unmetered usage within AWS. If you perform any sort of bioinformatics analysis on AWS, you should check it out!
