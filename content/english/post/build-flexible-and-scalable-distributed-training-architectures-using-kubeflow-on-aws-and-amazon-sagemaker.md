In this post, we demonstrate how Kubeflow on AWS (an AWS-specific distribution of Kubeflow) used with AWS Deep Learning Containers and Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) simplifies collaboration and provides flexibility in training deep learning models at scale on both Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) and Amazon SageMaker utilizing a hybrid architecture approach.
