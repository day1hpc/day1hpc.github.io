Predictive models have powered the design and analysis of real-world systems such as jet engines, automobiles, and powerplants for decades. These models are used to provide insights on system performance and to run simulations, at a fraction of the cost compared to experiments with physical hardware. In this first post of three, we described the motivation and general architecture of the open-source aws-do-pm framework project for building predictive models at scale in AWS.
