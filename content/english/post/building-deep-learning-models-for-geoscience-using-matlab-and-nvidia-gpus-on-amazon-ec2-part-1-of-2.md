In this blog post, we discuss how geoscientists can use shallow RNN-based algorithms with MATLAB to automatically recognize distinct geologic features in seismic images. We discuss the workflow for developing the AI models using MATLAB for seismic interpretation.Â  In a second post will introduce the various compute resources leveraged from AWS and NVIDIA for developing the models.
