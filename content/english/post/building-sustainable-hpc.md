You could be like Baker Hughes, and reduce your carbon footprint for your HPC cluster by 99%. How? Watch this talk by Francesco Ruffino, one of our global experts on HPC who has a passion for making HPC more efficient - and kinder to the planet.

We filmed this on site at ISC'24 where the theme was 'reinventing HPC'. The cloud is a perfect place to do just that.
