Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and AWS are joining forces to provide a training opportunity for emerging HPC tools and application. RADIUSS (Rapid Application Development via an Institutional Universal Software Stack) is a broad suite of open-source software projects originating from LLNL. Together we are hosting a tutorial series to give attendees hands-on experience with these cutting-edge technologies. Find out how to participate in these events in this blog post.
