Our CFD expert, Dr Neil Ashton put AWS's Arm-based CPU, the AWS Graviton, to the test with some CFD workloads and shares the results with us. If you're interested in CFD, or just wanting to find out if newer CPU architectures like the Graviton can deliver the performance you expect for HPC codes, you'll get some data to start you off.

Mentioned in the show: Neil's CFD workshops https://cfd-on-pcluster.workshop.aws

Not mentioned but also important: CFD Direct (two of the original authors of OpenFOAM) also have an offering in AWS Marketplace that runs on AWS Graviton and is really easy to launch. You can check it out here: https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B08CHKT98H

If you have ideas for technical topics you'd like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by finding us on Twitter (@TechHpc) and DM'ing us with your idea.
