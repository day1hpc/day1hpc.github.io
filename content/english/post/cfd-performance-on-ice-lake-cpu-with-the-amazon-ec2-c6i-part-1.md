Today we launched the new Amazon EC2 C6i instance family which is powered by the Intel Xeon Ice Lake processor and comes equipped with our Elastic Fabric Adapter.

Neil Ashton and Nicola Venuti joined us to talk about CFD performance on this new instance family, and spent some time comparing network connectivity options, too.

This is a two part series of Tech Shorts:

Part 1) Discuss C6i and how it's put together. Look at OpenFOAM and Siemens Simcenter StarCCM+
Part 2) Ansys Fluent, under populated cores, and some on-premises comparisons for calibration.

If you have ideas for technical topics you'd like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by finding us on Twitter (@TechHpc) and DM'ing us with your idea.
