We worked with our financial services customers to develop an open-source, scalable, cloud-native, high throughput computing solution on AWS â€” AWS HTC-Grid. HTC-Grid allows you to submit large volumes of short and long running tasks and scale environments dynamically. In this first blog of a two-part series, we describe the structure of HTC-Grid and its objective to provide a configurable blueprint for HPC grid scheduling on the cloud.
