Today is the first part of a 2-part series and we're covering all the aspects of designing and creating ParallelClusters using PCluster Manager, which is a graphical user interface tool for making all the hard bits of cluster management way less messy and so much easier. All the documentation in the world isn't as useful as this one tool.

In part 2, we'll dive into some advanced topics like debugging your cluster build when something goes wrong, and we'll show you some fancy access methods, and tools for managing jobs - and visualizing the results.

Sean Smith shows us how this is all a lot easier with the right tools. if you want to install PCluster Manager in your account, head over to hpc.news/pclustermanager and deploy one of the one-click lauchable stacks to get going. There's even an episode with Charlie (from our engineering team) showing how to install it and get it set up (it's here: https://youtu.be/Z1vlpJYb1KQ).

If you have ideas for technical topics you'd like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by finding us on Twitter (@TechHpc) and DM'ing us with your idea.
