In part 1, we covered all the aspects of designing and creating ParallelClusters in PCluster Manager. Today we delve into some more advanced topics like debugging your stack when something goes wrong, managing access to the cluster via the UI and CLI, and visualization, which is something that's just super hard to do anywhere else.

Sean Smith shows us how this is all a lot easier with the right tools. if you want to install PCluster Manager in your account, head over to hpc.news/pclustermanager and deploy one of the one-click lauchable stacks to get going. There's even an episode with Charlie (from our engineering team) showing how to install it and get it set up (it's here: https://youtu.be/Z1vlpJYb1KQ).

If you have ideas for technical topics you'd like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by finding us on Twitter (@TechHpc) and DM'ing us with your idea.
