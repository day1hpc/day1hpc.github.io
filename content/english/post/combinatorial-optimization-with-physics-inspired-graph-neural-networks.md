Combinatorial optimization problems, such as the traveling salesman problem where we are looking for an optimal path with a discrete number of variables, are pervasive across science and industry. Practical (and yet notoriously challenging) applications can be found in virtually every industry, such as transportation and logistics, telecommunications, and finance. For example, optimization algorithms help [â€¦]
