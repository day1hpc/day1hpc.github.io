With Hybrid Jobs, you can run algorithms that use both classical and quantum compute resources. These hybrid quantum-classical algorithms can help you optimize the performance of the quantum devices currently available. These algorithms are designed to maximize the benefits and reduce the drawbacks of both types of computational systems and are generally used to find the ground state or global minimum of a particular system.

Jordan Sullivan, our Developer Advocate for Amazon Braket, stopped by Tech Shorts to explain this.
