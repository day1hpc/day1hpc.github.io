Christian Kniep (our senior developer relations engineer) from HPC Engineering is back to finish the conversation we started about containers in HPC. Christian is leading the cause for containerization in HPC, and helping our engineering and product teams focus on enabling that path on AWS.

Today we're talking about how containers work in a shared infrastructure environment, with shared filesystems (like Lustre) and we'll also cover multi-node parallelism, too, since MPI is where it's at for many (most?) people in the HPC community.

(And we completely missed thew opportunity to make any April fools jokes, so everything we say is totally believable) :-)

If you have ideas for technical topics you'd like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by finding us on Twitter (@TechHpc) and DM'ing us with your idea.
