ParallelCluster 3.6 came with a bunch of new features, but the most important one for us today is CloudFormation support. As you’ll hear from Charlie and Matt in today’s tech short, this means we can all start sharing our favorite recipes for building clusters, which really shortens the path between having an idea and implementing it.

It also means you’re creating self-documenting infrastructure, because you write the documentation - the cloudformation template - first, and then use that documentation to create your clusters.

Here's the blog we talked about in the show today: https://hpc.news/cfn4pcluster

If you have ideas for technical topics you'd like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by finding us on Twitter (@TechHpc) and DM'ing us with your idea.
