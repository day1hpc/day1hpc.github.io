DCV started as a technology to make supercomputers feel local so you didn't need to be in a cold data center when you were visualizing massive datasets. But now it's so much more, because it's spread into every nook and cranny of both AWS *and* computing in general - starting with games.

We caught up with Paolo Maggi, the General Manager of Streaming Protocols at AWS while we were at SC'2 together in Dallas.
