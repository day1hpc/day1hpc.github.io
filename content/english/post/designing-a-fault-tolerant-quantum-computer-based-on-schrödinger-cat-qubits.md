At the AWS Center for Quantum Computing, we are doing scientific research and development on quantum computing algorithms and hardware. This post summarizes findings from our first architecture paper that describes a theoretical blueprint for a fault-tolerant quantum computer that features a novel approach to quantum error correction (QEC). Fair warning, this post dives somewhat […]
