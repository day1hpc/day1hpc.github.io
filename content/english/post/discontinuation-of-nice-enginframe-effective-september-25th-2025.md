After careful consideration, we have made the decision to discontinue NICE EnginFrame including NICE EnginFrame views, effective September 25, 2025. If you want to continue using NICE EnginFrame beyond the end-of-support date, we recommend contacting NI-SP, an AWS partner with decades of experience implementing and supporting NICE EnginFrame for enterprises.
