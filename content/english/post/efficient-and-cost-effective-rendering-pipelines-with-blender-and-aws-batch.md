This blog post explainsÂ how to run parallel rendering workloads and produce an animation in a cost and time effective way using AWS Batch and AWS Step Functions. AWS Batch manages the rendering jobs on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), and AWS Step Functions coordinates the dependencies across the individual steps of the rendering workflow. Additionally, Amazon EC2 Spot instances can be used to reduce compute costs by up to 90% compared to On-Demand prices.
