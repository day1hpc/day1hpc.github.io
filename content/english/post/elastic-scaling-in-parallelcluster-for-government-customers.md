If you're pondering a new procurement phase to build an HPC facility for your lab or agency, it's worth zooming out for a few minutes and seeing if the things you think you know about the cloud are still true. A lot has happened - especially at AWS in the last few years.

This is the third episode in a multi-part series to bring you up to speed with HPC at AWS - from a government customer point of view.

Today we tackle elastic scaling concepts in ParallelCluster so you can get your head around how it works and what's possible.
