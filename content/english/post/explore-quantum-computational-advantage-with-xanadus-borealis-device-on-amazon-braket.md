Today, we are excited to launch Borealis, a new quantum processing unit (QPU) on Amazon Braket. Borealis – a special-purpose QPU built by Xanadu – is the first publicly available quantum computer with a claim to quantum computational advantage (sometimes referred to as quantum supremacy or quantum advantage) in a peer-reviewed study. With this launch, […]
