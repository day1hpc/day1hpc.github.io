Introduction Customers exploring quantum computing often rely on existing algorithms to learn the basics or evaluate new services. Amazon Braket includes many such algorithms in its SDK and managed notebooks. In this post, we will explore one of the first quantum algorithms invented, and a new addition to our Amazon Braket examples: Simon’s algorithm. We […]
