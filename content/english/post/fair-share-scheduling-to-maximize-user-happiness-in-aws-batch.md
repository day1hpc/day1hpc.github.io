If you’re a frequent user of Batch queues, you have opinions about whether it’s scheduling is “fair” on your users.

But 'fair' means different things to everyone - what’s needed are some levers and dials that allow you to figure out what ‘fair’ means for your organization.

AWS Batch now has Fair Share Scheduling, and it comes with a whole lot of controls.

We’re joined this week on Tech Shorts by Aswin Damodar from the Batch engineering team, and Christian Kniep, our Snr Dev Advocate for HPC & Batch, to run through all these controls and what they mean.

I’m betting this video is going to get watched a LOT. Fair-share scheduling is a complex topic, but the discussion makes it a lot easier to understand that reading the documentation probably will the first time.

If you have ideas for technical topics you'd like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by finding us on Twitter (@TechHpc) and DM'ing us with your idea.
