Introduction – the need for randomness Random numbers are a crucial resource used throughout modern computer science. For example, in computation, randomized algorithms give efficient solutions for a variety of fundamental problems for which no deterministic algorithms are available. This includes Monte Carlo methods that have widespread applications in science for the simulation of physical, […]
