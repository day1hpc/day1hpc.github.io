Spack has already been removing the ugly work from building HPC codes, but with the announcement of the Spack Binary Cache at ISC'22, build and deploy times for these complicated applications will drop by 95% or more in most cases.

Greg Becker from Livermore came along to show us how it works, and discuss what's behind it.

You can find a blog post about the announcement here: hpc.news/binaryCache
