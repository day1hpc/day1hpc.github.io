In this blog post, weâ€™ll show how you can run NVIDIA Parabricks on AWS Batch leveraging AWS CloudFormation templates. Parabricks is a GPU-accelerated tool for secondary genomic analysis. It reduces the runtime of variant calling on a 30x human genome from 30 hours to just 30 minutes, and leverages AWS Batch to provide an interface that scales compute jobs across multiple instances in the cloud.
