Suppose you are trying to solve a problem of interest (e.g., portfolio optimization or machine learning), and you are given some classical data, neatly arranged into a matrix A. Your plan is to solve this problem using a quantum algorithm to process the data. For example, you may be trying to solve a linear system [â€¦]
