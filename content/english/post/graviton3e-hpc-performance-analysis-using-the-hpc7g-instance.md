We recently launched the Hpc7g instance using the Graviton3E, which is an HPC-specific versions of the Graviton3 CPU - our Arm64 architecture processor.

Today we're joined by two members of our HPC Performance Engineering team, who dig into the details of how these CPUs perform across a range of applications, and they give us some insight into what aspects of the syetem and CPU architecture are important for those different codes,

In the show we discuss a blog post which has all the results in detail. You can find it here: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/hpc/application-deep-dive-into-the-graviton3e-based-amazon-ec2-hpc7g-instance/

If you have ideas for technical topics you'd like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by finding us on Twitter (@TechHpc) and DM'ing us with your idea.
