See how researchers are using ML to try to predict aerodynamics and airflow for concept vehicle designs orders of magnitude faster than traditional methods.

Today we dive into the metrics for the work we've been doing with some key research partners, and report on how accurate the outcomes are - and how fast and cheap they are, too.

Machine learning could unlock a lot of creative freedom in design engineering. Join us on this tour inside the ML design lab of the future.
