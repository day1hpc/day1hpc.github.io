The Elastic Fabric Adapter was created so HPC and machine-learning customers could scale their tightly-coupled codes and models to thousands (and thousands) of cores without missing any performance. It has some very cool design features which means it can take advantage of the cloud's inherent scale to solve some problems that other interconnects struggle with.

In this Tech Shorts Foundations talk, we talk about how EFA works, so you can understand why we designed it, and why we're so confident it will help your workloads scale in the cloud.

If you have ideas for technical topics you'd like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by finding us on Twitter (@TechHpc) and DM'ing us with your idea.
