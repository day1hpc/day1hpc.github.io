Steve Litster leads the HCLS compute specialists team, and he's well known to most of that community because he's worked in research, and at a pharmaceutical company, *and* in the tech industry. But just speaking to him makes you realise it's not a job - he's on a mission to drive science to crazy new places, faster. He's impatient. And he's not doing it for the servers or the salary - he's here for the science.

Steve sat with us at SC'22 and explained how the tech we build is radically changing the healthcare and life sciences industry in some very cool ways.
