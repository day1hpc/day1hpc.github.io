At re:Invent '22 in Las vegas, AWS's CEO Adam Selipsky launched the Hpc6id instance family as part of an AWSome week of HPC innovation announcements.

The Hpc6id is amazing for structures simulations - the kinds of things that help engineers the world over design some impossible things. Karthik Raman joined us to talk about the Hpc6id and gave us an inside scoop on what makes them tick, and what workloads you can expect them to help with.
