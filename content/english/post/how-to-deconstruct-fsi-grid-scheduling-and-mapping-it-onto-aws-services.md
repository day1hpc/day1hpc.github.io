Last month we talked about the evolution of HPC workloads in the financial world. We agreed with Alex Kimber, our global FSI HPC expert, to come back and talk about how to deconstruct these very complex, high-speed, task scheduling environments and map them onto AWS services. This is cool because it lets us scale them even further in a bunch of new ways. it also means we can solve some tricky organizational problems (like sharing infra and cross-charging between depts) without any fuss at all.

Alex dives into this area in today's discussion.
