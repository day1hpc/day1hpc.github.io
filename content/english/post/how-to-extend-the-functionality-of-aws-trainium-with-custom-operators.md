Deep learning (DL) is a fast-evolving field, and practitioners are constantly innovating DL models and inventing ways to speed them up. Custom operators are one of the mechanisms developers use to push the boundaries of DL innovation by extending the functionality of existing machine learning (ML) frameworks such as PyTorch. In general, an operator describes [â€¦]
