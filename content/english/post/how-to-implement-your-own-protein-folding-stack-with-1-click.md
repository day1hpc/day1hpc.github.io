Protein folding has changed the workflow in drug discovery, complementing lab work and tools like CryoEM. But the software stacks are complex and scaling them takes a lot of work. Added to that, there's a growing list of methods, following on from AlphaFold and OpenFold.

He and the team have released new architecture guidance and a one-click template, which you can build from to create your own custom environment.

The details are all here:
