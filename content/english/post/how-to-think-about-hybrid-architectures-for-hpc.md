If you're pondering a a hybrid HPC setup between your on-prem HPC cluster and the cloud, it's worth exploring how well you understand you local users, daily workflows, and the ... rhythm of your environment. Just a few minutes of thinking about this will help you make some crazy good decisions that'll save you huge amounts of effort trying to solve problems that, frankly, you probably don't need to solve.

Brian Skjerven is an expert at simplifying this challenge. And so we're glad we could get the time with him to discuss this just after ISC finished in Hamburg. We recorded some talks in the lobby of our hotel, before we fled to the airport.
