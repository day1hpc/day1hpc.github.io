The entire FSI space has changed the way it approaches HPC radically in the last few years - partly driven by regulatory changes (like FRTB) and partly due to changing work practices with the wide availability of cloud capacity.

This is the fist in a multi-part series about FSI HPC.

Today, Alex Kimber - our chief HPC FSI nerd - talks to us about all these issues, and gets  us read for a deep dive an HTC solution he and his team have built.

If you have ideas for technical topics you'd like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by emailing us at ask-hpc@amazon.com.
