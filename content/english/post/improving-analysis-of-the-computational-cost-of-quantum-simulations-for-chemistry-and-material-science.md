This post summarizes a recent research paper from the AWS Center for Quantum Computing. The paper provides an improved analysis of quantum simulation of chemical and material systems. This research shows that such simulations can be implemented using fewer elementary quantum operations than previously thought. Computer simulations enable scientists to test their intuition about the [â€¦]
