'Infrastructure as Code' has a weird meaning in HPC, because it says we can write a script which stands up the entire incredibly complex software stack that is an HPC cluster, complete with MPIs, math libraries, schedulers - and even a parallel file system and visualization server.

Austin Cherian takes us for a walk through the new ParallelCluster 3 config file and shows how the syntax aligns with the significant elements of the cluster architecture. He also talks about a few quirks we found along the way.
