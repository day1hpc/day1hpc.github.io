Today weâ€™re announcing the release of AWS ParallelCluster 3.1 which now supports multiuser authentication based on Active Directory (AD). Starting with v3.1.1 clusters can be configured to use an AD domain managed via one of the AWS Directory Service options like Simple AD or AWS Managed Microsoft AD (MSAD). This blog post describes the new feature, and gives an example of a configuration block for ParallelCluster 3 configuration files.
