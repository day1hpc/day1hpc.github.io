Are you looking for an easy way to build a powerful HPC environments on AWS?

This video introduces HPC Recipes, a game-changing library of modular templates that makes it much easier to launch fully-configured HPC systems with just a few clicks.

HPC Recipes eliminates the complexity of knowing all the details for things like networking, storage, identity management, and more. There's plenty of time to learn about those things once you've first made sure that this cloud thing works.

Matt walks through real examples of spinning up benchmark-ready clusters, complete with persistent storage, user management, and optimized instance types - all without having to be a cloud expert! And you're probably only a handful of minor changes from a production ready system when you're ready to do that.

Whether you're new to HPC or a seasoned pro, AWS HPC Recipes will save you lots of time and effort.
