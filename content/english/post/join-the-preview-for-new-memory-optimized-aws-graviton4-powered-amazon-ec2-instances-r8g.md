We are opening up a preview of the next generation of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. Equipped with brand-new Graviton4 processors, the new R8g instances will deliver better price performance than any existing memory-optimized instance. The R8g instances are suitable for your most demanding memory-intensive workloads: big data analytics, high-performance databases, in-memory caches [â€¦]
