RONIN is probably the easiest way for a research scientist or engineer to be able to quickly jump into the cloud on AWS and get stuff done. And they've made a regular habit of delighting their customers by making hard things easy.

In this Tech Short, Tara from RONIN shows us how to spin up a Linux machine and connect to it securely. All of this happens inside the safety and governance of RONIN's security posture and it's budget management guardrails.

More on all of this is available at www.ronin.cloud.

If you have ideas for technical topics you'd like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by finding us on Twitter (@TechHpc) and DM'ing us with your idea.
