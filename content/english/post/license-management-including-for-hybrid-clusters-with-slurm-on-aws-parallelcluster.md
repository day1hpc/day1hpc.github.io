If you've moved some of your HPC infrastructure to the cloud, chances are you've tried to figure out how to manage commercial software licenses that need to span both on-premises and on AWS.

Fear not, because Brian Skjerven from our HPC specialist team figured it out so you don't have to. We talked with him at SC'22, and he showed us how it works.

If you have ideas for technical topics you'd like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by finding us on Twitter (@TechHpc) and DM'ing us with your idea.
