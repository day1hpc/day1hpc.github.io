Introduction This post summarizes a research paper from the AWS Center for Quantum Computing that proposes a direction to implement fault-tolerant quantum computers with minimal hardware overhead. This research shows that by concatenating the surface code with Gottesman, Kitaev, and Preskill (GKP) qubits, it is theoretically possible to achieve a logical error rate of 10-8 [â€¦]
