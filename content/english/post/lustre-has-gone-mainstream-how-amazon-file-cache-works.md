Amazon File Cache is a service that's bringing Lustre mainstream (yes, we know that sounds crazy). Lustre has been serving the HPC community for a few decades now, and it's weird and wild that it's now being used as a super high performance caching layer for other more ... sedate file services like Amazon S3 and NFS to provide an insane performance boost.

Darryl Osborne from the engineering team that created Amazon File Cache came to Tech Shorts to explain how this all works, and show it to us in action.
