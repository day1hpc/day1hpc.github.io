Scientific software is almost defined by it's complexity. But just because it was hard to write doesn't mean it should be hard to build and even harder to run well. EESSI is a project that aims to change that by making architecture-specific binaries available to be streamed to your machine or your cluster, just by reaching out and asking it for them.

Kenneth and Alan - two leaders from the EasyBuild and EESSI projects - came to show us what this idea is, and how it works. Genius.

You can get more information about the project at https://eessi.github.io/docs/ or by joining their slack at https://www.eessi-hpc.org/join and getting involved.

If you have ideas for technical topics you'd like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by finding us on Twitter (@TechHpc) and DM'ing us with your idea.
