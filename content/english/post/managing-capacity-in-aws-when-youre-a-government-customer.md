If you're pondering a new procurement phase to build an HPC facility for your lab or agency, it's worth zooming out for a few minutes and seeing if the things you think you know about the cloud are still true. A lot has happened - especially at AWS in the last few years.

This is the fourth show in a multi-part series to bring you up to speed with HPC at AWS - from a government customer point of view.

Today we talk about tools for managing capacity in the cloud - from ODCR's (not a model of Corvette ... really) through to reserved instances and savings plans.

If you have ideas for technical topics you'd like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by emailing us at ask-hpc@amazon.com.
