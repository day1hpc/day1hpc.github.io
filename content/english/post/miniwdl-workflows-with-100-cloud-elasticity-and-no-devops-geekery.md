Mike Lin is the creator and maintainer of miniWDL and has been working with our Genomics and ML teams to integrate it with Sagemaker Studio and AWS  Batch. The result is a working environment that's completely familiar and easy to use (it's Jupyter, after all) and yet has access to all the elasticity of the cloud, but without ever needing to leave the familiar notebook interface to make that magic happen.

It's a really cool example of bringing the tools to science, rather than forcing the scientists to understand yet another new tool.
