In this video, learn how decoupling key filesystems from your head node with Amazon EFS can prevent meltdowns from pathological jobs.

Plus, provision persistent shared storage for /home directories across cluster lifecycles. Join us as we dive into the simple configuration changes that unlock a world of potential.

If you have ideas for technical topics you'd like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by emailing us at ask-hpc@amazon.com.
