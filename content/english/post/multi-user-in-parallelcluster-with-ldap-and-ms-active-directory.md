Customers have been asking us to make it easy to configure ParallelCluster to use a corporate directory server, so adding a user to the cloud HPC stack becomes as easy as adding them to (say) the Engineering Group in Active Directory or LDAP.

We're happy to say we've done that, and released a blog about it a couple weeks ago. In today's  show, Giacomo Marciani (one of the developers who built this feature) came along to explain how it works and give us a demo, so you can get to the important steps fast.

During the show we spoke about a blog and a tutorial. They' right here:

* Tutorial: https://hpc.news/hawking513

If you have ideas for technical topics you'd like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by finding us on Twitter (@TechHpc) and DM'ing us with your idea.
