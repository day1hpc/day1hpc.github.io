The AWS Batch team recently added container insights and advanced logging features to the Batch console, which is making a LOT of people very happy.

We decided to catch up with the dev team in Seattle who worked on this, and one of my favotire Amazonians - David Chambers - joined me to help us all understand what this means to Batch users and to taker us for a drive to sere how easy it is.

This is our first ever in-person Tech Short, which is something we're really keen to build on, now that travel is starting to happen more. Hope you like it.

If you have ideas for technical topics you'd like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by finding us on Twitter (@TechHpc) and DM'ing us with your idea.
