The world of bioinformatics is rapidly advancing, but scientists often face barriers when trying to analyze huge amounts of genomic data. Today we take a look inside to see how Nextflow and open-source tools are removing those barriers.

We sat down with Paolo Di Tommaso, the CTO and co-founder of both Seqera and Nextflow, to ponder how seeking to solve one problem often leads to fixing several others.

If you're a researcher or business optimizing bioinformatics pipelines, this is worth catching.
