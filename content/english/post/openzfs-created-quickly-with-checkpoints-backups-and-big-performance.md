We launched Amazon FSx for OpenZFS at re:invent in December, and well let's just say it's been more than a bit popular :-)

ZFS and it's friends have been a long time favorite of the HPC community, so we asked Delwin Olivan, the Snr Product Manager for the service to come and show us how easy it is to get big scale, and big performance with very little effort.

Auto-backups and one-click snapshots are _exactly_ as they're described on the lid. Which is awesome.

If you have ideas for technical topics you'd like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by finding us on Twitter (@TechHpc) and DM'ing us with your idea.
