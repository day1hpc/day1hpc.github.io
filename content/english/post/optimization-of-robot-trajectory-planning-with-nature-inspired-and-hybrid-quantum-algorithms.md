Introduction The problem of robot motion planning is pervasive across many industry verticals, including (for example) automotive, manufacturing, and logistics. In the automotive industry, robotic path optimization problems can be found across the value chain in body shops, paint shops, assembly, and logistics, among others [1]. Typically, hundreds of robots operate in a single plant [â€¦]
