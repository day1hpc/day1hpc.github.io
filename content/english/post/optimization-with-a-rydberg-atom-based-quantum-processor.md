Amazon Braket recently launched the Aquila quantum processing unit (QPU) based on Rydberg atoms by QuEra Computing. In a previous post, we explored how researchers can use Rydberg devices to study problems and quantum phenomena in fundamental physics, for instance the emergence of a spin liquid phase [Semeghini et al., 2021]. But QuEra’s device also […]
