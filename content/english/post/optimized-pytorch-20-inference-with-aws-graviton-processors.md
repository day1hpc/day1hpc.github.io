New generations of CPUs offer a significant performance improvement in machine learning (ML) inference due to specialized built-in instructions. Combined with their flexibility, high speed of development, and low operating cost, these general-purpose processors offer an alternative to other existing hardware solutions. AWS, Arm, Meta and others helped optimize the performance of PyTorch 2.0 inference [â€¦]
