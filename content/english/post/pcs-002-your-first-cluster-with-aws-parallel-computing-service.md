In 45 minutes you'll pick up all you need to know to build a complete HPC cluster on AWS. Imagine: an entire HPC cluster - soup to nuts, including fast network, high performance Lustre storage, and hundreds or even thousands of cores at your fingertips - in just a morning's work.

This uses the new AWS Parallel Computing Service, which is for customers who run high performance computing (HPC) workloads and build scientific and engineering models so they can accelerate their R&D and drive innovation.
