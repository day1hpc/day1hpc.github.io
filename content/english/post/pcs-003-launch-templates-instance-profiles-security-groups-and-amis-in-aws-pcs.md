AWS Parallel Computing Service makes use of a lot of AWS technologies to enable you to abstract and tease out the layers of your complex software stacks and the environments they run in.

Matt shows us how to extract the maximum benefits from using Launch templates, instance profiles,  security groups , and AMIs to your advantage.

Introducing AWS Parallel Computing Service, which is for customers who run high performance computing (HPC) workloads and build scientific and engineering models so they can accelerate their R&D and drive innovation.

If you have ideas for technical topics you'd like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by emailing us at ask-hpc@amazon.com.
