Tired of spending hours manually building and maintaining AMIs?

Say goodbye to long waits watching install scripts and wrestling with EC2 tools. Learn how EC2 Image Builder can automate and simplify AMI creation.

In this video, we show you how to set up an image pipeline using EC2 Image Builder. See how easy it is to build recipes, add components like security updates, and distribute AMIs across regions.

This is a basic intro, and in the next video, we'll give deep with a real concrete example, specifically for HPC use case with AWS Parallel Computing Service.

If you have ideas for technical topics you'd like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by emailing us at ask-hpc@amazon.com.
