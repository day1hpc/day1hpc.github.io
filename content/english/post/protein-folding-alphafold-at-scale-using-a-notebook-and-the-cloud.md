Protein folding simulations can consume huge CPU time on supercomputers. AlphaFold changed that by applying ML techniques to the task. Then the problem became 'how do I run AlphaFold easily?'.

The Healthcare AI/ML team at AWS figured that out, built a really accessible solution and open-sourced it to GitHub, which is where you can grab it today.

Brian Loyal and Ujjwal Ratan from the AI/ML specialist team in our global HCLS org joined us to help understand how this fits, why it works, and described some of the awesome science it supports.

They blogged about it here: https://hpc.news/curie264
The CloudFormation stack is here: https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-batch-architecture-for-alphafold
