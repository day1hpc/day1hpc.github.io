Robin Knowles has been doing CFD for longer than he'll admit. He's become well known for his newsletter which delivers weekly tips and tricks for using OpenFOAM, and increasingly OpenFOAM on AWS.

Rob stopped by Tech Shorts to help us understand what it is about this magic combination that's allowed him to build a business and career, and - most importantly - which has democratized this amazing resource that's used in almost every industrial segment now.

You can find Robin, and his newletter at https://www.cfdengine.com/newsletter/

If you have ideas for technical topics you'd like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by emailing us at ask-hpc@amazon.com.
