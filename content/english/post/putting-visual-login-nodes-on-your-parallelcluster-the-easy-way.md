Looking for an easy way to offer your ParallelCluster environment to your end users through a visual interface? Look no further!

We're excited to show you how to seamlessly connect ParallelCluster with Research & Engineering Studio (RES).

This powerful combination gives you near instant access to your HPC environment right from within RES's interactive desktops portal. You can visualize results, collaborate with teammates, and manage jobs - all without leaving your browser.

See how to:
- Quickly spin up a virtual desktop in RES preloaded with your HPC cluster login node
- Submit and monitor jobs, check the queue, and more
- Configure custom desktops with specific software stacks or hardware needs

With this integration, you eliminate the hassles of slow desktops, software access issues, and sharing compute resources. Plus, it's quick and easy to set up using our guide.

If you have ideas for technical topics you'd like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by emailing us at ask-hpc@amazon.com.
