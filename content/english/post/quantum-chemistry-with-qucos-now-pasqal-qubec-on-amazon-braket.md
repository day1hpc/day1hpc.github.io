(Update: Pasqal and Qu&Co announced a merger on January 11, 2022.) In this post, we discuss the progress and limitations of chemistry simulations on current quantum computers, and introduce Qu&Co‘s QUBEC, a quantum computational platform that is specifically designed for chemistry and materials science simulations. The post describes QUBEC’s architecture and how it integrates with […]
