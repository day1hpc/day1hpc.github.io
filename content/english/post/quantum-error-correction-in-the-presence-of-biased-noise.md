Have you ever heard about error correction? Without it, we could not obtain awe-inspiring pictures of Jupiter and its moons, conduct intelligible mobile phone calls, or have reliable computers. In this blog post, we explain the basic ideas behind error correction and how to apply it to quantum computing. In addition, we discuss how we [â€¦]
