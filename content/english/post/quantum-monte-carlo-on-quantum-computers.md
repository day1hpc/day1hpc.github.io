In this blog post we develop a chemistry use case by augmenting classical algorithms for Quantum Monte Carlo with quantum computers. We will explain how to run these quantum-classical hybrid algorithms using Amazon Braket. You can find the code presented in this blog post in an accompanying Jupyter notebook. Overview Accurately determining the electronic energies [â€¦]
