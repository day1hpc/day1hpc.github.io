This week at re:Invent, we announced the future availability of a Rydberg-atom based quantum computer from QuEra Computing. Launching in 2022, it will introduce a new quantum computing paradigm to Amazon Braket, Analog Hamiltonian Simulation (AHS). AHS uses programmable quantum devices to emulate the behavior of other quantum mechanical systems. Already today, researchers in academia [â€¦]
