reInvent '21 is over, but it was a busy week with new tech developments we've built for customers in pretty much every area of HPC: storage, networking and compute.

We talk with our HPC General Manager, Ian Colle, about ZFS, Lustre, Graviton3, DDR5, EFA at 400 Gb/s on dozens of instances ... and a lot more.

If you didn't get to reinvent, or even if you did and couldn't be in 10 places at once, this is a compact recap for you.

If you have ideas for technical topics you'd like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by finding us on Twitter (@TechHpc) and DM'ing us with your idea.
