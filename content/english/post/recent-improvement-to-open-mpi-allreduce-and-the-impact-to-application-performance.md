Our team engineered some Open MPI optimizations for EFA to enhance performance of HPC codes running in the cloud. By improving MPI_AllReduce they improved scaling â€“ matching commercial MPIs. Tests show gains for apps including Code Saturne and OpenFOAM on both Arm64 and x86 instances. Check out how these tweaks can speed up your HPC workloads in the cloud.
