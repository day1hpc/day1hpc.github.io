Intrigued by how advanced robotics and simulation can optimize industrial operations? Today we offer a behind-the-scenes look at how Robotec.ai leverages Batch's new multi-container features to simulate autonomous vehicle environments in mines, on farms, and in warehouse.

Watch as robots autonomously navigate underground tunnels, calculating optimal routes and tweaking productivity. Dominik Jargot from Robotec demonstrates ROSI - their simulation platform. He shows how they can easily swap out components like autonomous vehicle software to test different systems. You'll see how running parallel batch jobs on AWS Batch enables Robotech to simulate operations in a fraction of real-time, allowing customers to efficiently evaluate countless scenarios.
