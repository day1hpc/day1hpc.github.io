In this blog post, we’ll describe an ensemble run of 20K simulations to accelerate the drug discovery process, while also optimizing for run time and cost. We used two popular open-source packages — GROMACS, which does a molecular dynamics simulations, and pmx, a free-energy calculation package from the Computational Biomolecular Dynamics Group at Max Planck Institute in Germany.
