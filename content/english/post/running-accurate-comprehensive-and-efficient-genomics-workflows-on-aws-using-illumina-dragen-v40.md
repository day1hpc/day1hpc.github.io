In this blog, we provide a walkthrough of running Illumina DRAGEN v4.0 genomic analysis pipelines on AWS, showing accuracy and efficiency, copy number analysis, structural variants, SMN callers, repeat expansion detection, and pharmacogenomics insights for complex genes. We also highlight some benchmarking results for runtime, cost, and concordance from the Illumina DRAGEN DNA sequencing pipeline.
