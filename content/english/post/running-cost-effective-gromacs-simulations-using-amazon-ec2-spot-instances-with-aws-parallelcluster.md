In this blog post, we cover how to run GROMACS – a popular open source designed for simulations of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids – cost effectively by leveraging EC2 Spot Instances within AWS ParallelCluster. We also show how to checkpoint GROMACS to recover gracefully from possible Spot Instance interruptions.
