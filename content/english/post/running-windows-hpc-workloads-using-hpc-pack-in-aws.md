This blog post shows you how to deploy an HPC cluster for Windows workloads. We have provided an AWS CloudFormation template that automates the creation process to deploy an HPC Pack 2019 Windows cluster. This will help you get started quickly to run Windows-based HPC workloads, while leveraging highly scalable, resilient, and secure AWS infrastructure. As an example, we show how to run a sample parametric sweep for EnergyPlus, an open source energy simulation tool maintained by the U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s Building Technology Office.
