Cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) allows drug discovery researchers to determine the three-dimensional structures of molecules critical to drug discovery. As Cryo-EM adoption has increased, scientists and IT owners have looked for ways to efficiently process the terabytes (and terabytes) of data generated each day by these microscopes. These processing pipelines need scalable, heterogeneous compute combined [â€¦]
