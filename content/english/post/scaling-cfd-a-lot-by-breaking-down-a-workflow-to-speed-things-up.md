Sometimes when we're looking for performance we lose the forrest for all those trees - we miss the huge improvements we can do to unglamorous parts of the overall workflow, while we obsess on the pieces that look hard. It's an engineer thing, I think.

In today's Tech Short, Neil Ashton shows us exactly this kind of example from the world of CFD (using OpenFOAM, but this lesson applies generally) - and shows us how to break the problem down in order to speed it all up - and pretty easily, too.

The workshops we reference in the discussion are all listed here: https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/cfd/
