If you have budget anxiety about overspending in your AWS account because you left something turned on, then Matt Vaughn has a solution for you. It's a short procedure documented in a blog post that will let you send alerts to your phone, and your Slack channels, to let you know when your spending has crossed a threshold that you set.

That threshold can be 1 cent, or it could be 80% of your planned monthly spend. Both kinds of alerts are useful for learning about what your consumption patterns are like, and getting pinged when they get too high.

Matt and Boof explain this in today's Tech Short, and the implementation is documented in a blog on our day1hpc community website here:
