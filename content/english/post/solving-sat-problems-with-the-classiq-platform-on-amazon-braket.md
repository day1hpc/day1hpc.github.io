Boolean satisfiability problems (SAT) are a well-known class of difficult (NP-Complete) computational problems. The process of finding solutions to these problems can be performed using quantum computers. In this post, we will describe what SAT problems are and show you how to express SAT problems with the Classiq quantum algorithm design platform. We will outline [â€¦]
