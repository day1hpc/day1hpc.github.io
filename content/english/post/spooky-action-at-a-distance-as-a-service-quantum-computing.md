Amazon Braket is AWS's Quantum Computing service which gives you access to several Quantum Computers using a serverless programming model and ... YOU ACTUALLY GET TO USE REAL QUANTUM COMPUTERS without needing a $50M budget and a cryo facility.

This is therefore one of the weirdest Tech Shorts we've done. We even run a Quantum version of 'Hello, world'. No kidding.

You can get more information about the service at aws.amazon.com/braket

But : why not try it yourself?
