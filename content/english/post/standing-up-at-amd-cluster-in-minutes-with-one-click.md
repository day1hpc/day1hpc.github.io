If you saw our talk at the AMD booth at SC'24, where we showed you how easy it is to make huge performance gains by running you workloads on our AMD-based Amazon EC2 instances - like the C7a and Hpc7a families - then you'll be happy to know it's not hard to get running with this in your own AWS account right away.

You can launch our custom one-click launcher for AMD, which is part of our HPC Recipes Library - a vast collection of compatible stacks that you can plug together to assemble really complex architectures.

The Recipe Library enables you to get to a final working solution quickly, skipping the learning curve, but still adopting safe and secure best practices. 

And all the templates we ship are well commented, and documented, so when you're ready to dive into the details, it's not hard to learn what's going on. That means you can make meaningful modifications, forking the recipes, and making it suit your needs for your HPC site.

It's not for nothing that we say it's like standing on the shoulders of ... someone else :-)

Thanks to our friends at AMD for creating great processors, and helping us prove these stacks.

If you have ideas for technical topics you'd like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by emailing us at ask-hpc@amazon.com.
