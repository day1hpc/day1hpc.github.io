In this post, we’ll explore quantum computing using Amazon Braket. We’ll take an educational approach for this by using a well-known quantum algorithm, Grover’s algorithm. We’ll first explain how Grover’s algorithm works, then we’ll introduce the dinner party problem which involves identifying a set of friends that can be invited together to a party satisfying […]
