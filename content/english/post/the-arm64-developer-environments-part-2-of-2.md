Olly Perks - our resident Arm64 architecture expert and all round HPC software guy - walks us through the quite extensive support for HPC developers who are planning to work on AWS Graviton processors.

There's a lot of software and it comes from a number of sources, including open source and commercial groups.

This is part 2 of a two-part series - the first part was published last week, abd you can find it here: https://youtu.be/qFrpmgvN9Xs

If you have ideas for technical topics you'd like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by finding us on Twitter (@TechHpc) and DM'ing us with your idea.
