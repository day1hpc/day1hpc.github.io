If you’ve looked at AWS in the past and thought our pricing wasn’t right, you should have a look again with these HPC instances firmly in mind. Hopefully, it’ll surprise you – in a good way.

They’re all built for speed, have great memory bandwidth, and high-speed networking. But they're also veruy low on price. We’ve taken out everything that didn’t need to be there to support HPC, and put lots of thing in to give you all the controls you need.
