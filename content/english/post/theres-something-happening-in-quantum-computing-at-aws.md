Amazon BraKet is probably the most unusual service in AWS. It's a fully-managed service with APIs for accessing real, live, quantum computers living in cryogenic labs all around the world.

And if that wasn't weird enough for you, some of the new features the team have been adding recently bear all the signs of being developed by quite devious minds intent on making esoteric  and very expensive resources incredibly accessible to anyone with a good idea to try out.

We spoke to Richard Moulds, the GM of Amazon BraKet, to find out what his team has been up to.
