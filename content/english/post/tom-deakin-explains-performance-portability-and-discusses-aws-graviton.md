Tom Deakin (and his colleague Simon McIntosh Smith) work on the hard problem of performance portability - the task of getting great performance out of software running on a range of computer architectures. This means they're often digging deep into workloads that find specific challenges with not just hardware, but compilers and libraries - virtually everything in the stack is fair game.

Tom and I caught up in Bristol before Christmas and he filled me in on a number of things they've found already, and also gave us an early report card on the AWS Graviton3, which is our Arm-architecture CPU - but he covers a lot of other ground, too. It's a great discussion.
