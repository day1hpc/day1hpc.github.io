Amazon EC2 is the engine that powers HPC in the cloud. There's quite a lot that's new if you've never seen it before. in this Level 1 module in the Tech Shorts Foundations Series, we aim to demystify EC2 for the HPC community.

We'll expand the number of videos in this series over time - but if there's a topic that's really interesting to you that we're overlooking, don't hesitate to contact us.

If you have ideas for technical topics you'd like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by finding us on Twitter (@TechHpc) and DM'ing us with your idea.
