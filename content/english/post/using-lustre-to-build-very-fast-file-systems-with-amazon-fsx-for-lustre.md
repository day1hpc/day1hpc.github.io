The Amazon Fsx for Lustre team have managed to turn what used to be a multi-year process to buy and build a Lustre filesystem, into a simple process with a launch button on the front.

It's hard to overstate the pain that this saves, but the most interesting things to ponder are the consequences of it. Jordan Dolman from the FSx Lustre team shows us some of the more unusual things you can do with Fsx Lustre that you just couldn't think about doing any other way.

Storage is one of the foundational layers we covered in the AWS HPC Speeds'n'Feeds event in early Feb 2022. if you missed it, head over to https://hpc.news/SpeedsFeeds to watch the replay.

If you have ideas for technical topics you'd like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by finding us on Twitter (@TechHpc) and DM'ing us with your idea.
