Ever had to figure out an HPC application with a visual desktop mode before? Sean Smith has - he helps customers all time to set up really well-designed HPC clusters on AWS with access to top flight visualization features that feel like they're running locally.

Along the way, he's worked out how to do it pretty quickly, and thought up some neat solutions that reduce the cost of doing it, too. We caught up with him at re:Invent'22 in Vegas, and he took us for a drive through his latest creation, using StarCMM+ as his favorite example.

If you have ideas for technical topics you'd like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by finding us on Twitter (@TechHpc) and DM'ing us with your idea.
