Amazon Braket is a service that's quite different from our other compute offerings. It's serverless, but .. the 'servers' that live behind it are in cryogenic labs all around the world. This is research, done collaboratively, with partners who are developing some of the most exciting approaches to problem solving we've seen.

Jordan Sullivan is the Developer Advocate for Amazon Braket, and stopped by Tech Shorts to help us make this foundational video.
