AWS Batch is a fully-managed AWS service that orchestrates vast numbers of jobs using containers. It leverages some of your favorite container systems - Amazon ECS and Kubernetes, and - above all: makes your life easier because it handles all the messy infrastructure for you, so you can focus on your task at hand (like designing that new AI that's going to pick up the kids from school).

This talk is part of the tech Shorts Foundations series, which aims to make AWS understandable to HPC people who haven't been following every detail of the cloud's evolution, but need to come up to speed on what it does and how it works.
