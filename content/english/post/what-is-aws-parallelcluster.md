If you're new to AWS and wanting to do some HPC work, then it's likely ParallelCluster is a tool you should understand. It's creates and manages full-featured HPC clusters for you - in minutes. And those clusters can do some weird and magical things, like provision compute fleets out of nowhere, and spin up filesystems or graphical consoles when you need them.

This talk is part of the tech Shorts Foundations series, which aims to make AWS understandable to HPC people who haven't been following every detail of the cloud's evolution, but need to come up to speed on what it does and how it works.
