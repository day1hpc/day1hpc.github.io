The AWS Graviton 3 will be launched this year as part of the new C7g instance. Inside this chip are some interesting innovations that already have a lot of HPC and AI/ML customers interested.

We sat down with Olly Perks, who recently joined AWS HPC Engineering from Arm, to discuss what's most interesting. This is the first of a series of Tech Shorts covering the Graviton 3 architecture. We'll deep dive on techniques and tools for getting the most out of these CPUs.

If you have ideas for technical topics you'd like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by finding us on Twitter (@TechHpc) and DM'ing us with your idea.
