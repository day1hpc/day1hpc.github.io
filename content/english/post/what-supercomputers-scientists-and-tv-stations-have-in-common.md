CDI (Cloud Digital Interface) uses EFA to blast broadcast quality video, uncompressed, from instance to instance in the cloud as live video feeds its way through complex stacks of software and makes its way to your TV set.

It's one of the more unusual use cases we've heard for a technology that we invented for keeping highly parallel scientific applications in sync when running in HPC environments in the cloud. Yes, that's weird.

Evan Statton from our media and entertainment tech team talks about how this happened and why it's so useful.
