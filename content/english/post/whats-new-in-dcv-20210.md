DCV was originally built for supercomputing centers to push pixels over the internet and enable a scientist or aerospace engineer to feel like they had an HPC cluster under their desk when inspecting detailed imagery or manipulating designs.

Now it's getting used _way_ beyond HPC in gaming, software development and ... enabling lots of us to be productive working from home.

All these little things make the desktop virtualization experience more real, so we decided to catch up with Rey Wang (Sr Product Manager for DCV) and Paolo Maggi (the GM for our DCV organization) to find out what's new.

You can find out more about DCV here: aws.amazon.com/hpc/dcv and you can also watch the Tech Short we did last week on DCV's better faster and more amazing streaming capabilities which are driving gaming engines to deliver rich experience in 4K @ 60 FPS (which we all know is essential ... right?).

If you have ideas for technical topics you'd like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by finding us on Twitter (@TechHpc) and DM'ing us with your idea.
