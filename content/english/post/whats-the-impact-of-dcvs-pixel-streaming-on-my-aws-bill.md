Since our NICE DCV high performance desktop and application streaming product does such a great job of making it feel like you have a cloud dat center sitting behind your laptop screen somewhere, lots of customers have asked 'Won't that impact my bill? You guys charge for data, right?'.

There's no way to give a precise answer, but what we did do was to put together a range of usage scenarios from fairly pedestrian usage (doing work processing on a remote windows machine) through to high bit-rate gaming and video streaming. We tested them all and measured their consumption. And we show you the results. Bottom line: data charges are't really going to nudge your billing by much unless you're getting close to 4K video streaming.

Jyothi Venkatesh and Boof put DCV to the test, and we walk you through the scenarios and our analysis. 

If you have ideas for technical topics you'd like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by finding us on Twitter (@TechHpc) and DM'ing us with your idea.
