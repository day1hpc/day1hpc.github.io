Fascinated by the behind-the-scenes science that brings steak to your plate? Today we discuss how Gencove works at the intersection of genomics and data science to solve hard problems. Some generate new techniques - like gleaning new insights out of old data -  and some are just more practical and involve putting food on your plate.

The team at Gencove long ago ported most of their workloads to AWS Graviton, which is about 40% lower cost than x86 alternatives ... and that means THEY CAN JUST GET MORE SCIENCE DONE.

Follow along as scientists explain how advanced genome sequencing and data analysis helps identify cattle with superior marbling. Learn how long-read sequencing technology uncovers structural variations in DNA that can predict disease, or the juiciness of a steak.
