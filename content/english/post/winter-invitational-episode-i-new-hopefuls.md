This is the first part of a two-part set about the Winter Invitational Student Cluster Competition (which the AWS HPC team supported as one of four mentor teams). The competition targeted academic institutions that we need to succeed to bring some balance to the HPC force.

Dan Olds, the Chief Research Officer of Intersect360, and the unofficial historian (and historical figure) of Student Cluster Comps, joined us to walk us through the structure of the comp, and feed us some of the drama leading up to an extraordinary result in 2022. 

This isn't just about the competition or the results. It's about the skills that are important to getting a job, learning new things and solving tough problems while working together with other people.

If you're able to support these kinds of events, you should give it a try. it's super rewarding. And if you're wondering what it's like to compete, watch these episodes, and you might be inspired.

If you have ideas for technical topics you'd like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by finding us on Twitter (@TechHpc) and DM'ing us with your idea.
