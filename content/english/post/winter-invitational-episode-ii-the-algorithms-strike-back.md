This is the second part of a two-part set about the Winter Invitational Student Cluster Competition, which the AWS HPC team supported as one of four mentor teams.

This isn't just about the competition or the results. It's about the skills that are important to getting a job, learning new things and solving tough problems. And it's about working together with other people.

If you're able to support these kinds of events, you should give it a try. it's super rewarding.
