YellowDog (yellowdog.co) cut their teeth in the media and entertainment industry working on orchestrating really large workloads for CGI and FX companies. They've generalized the platform and now they're able to do the same thing for nearly any kind of workload in the cloud (or hybrid on-prem/cloud scenarios).

They understand the complexities of doing this, and have features and tooling for dealing with the nitty gritty (rationing licenses for ISV applications, data movement and staging etc etc).

Alan Parry, their Director of Engineering showed us how easy it is.

In the show, we mentioned a blog post, which you can find here: https://hpc.news/hawking901
