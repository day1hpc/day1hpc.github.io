Sometimes creature comforts and easy buttons just rock. This is one of those times. If you've been using AWS Batch you might have often said 'I wish I could put different information on this &^%# dashboard screen'. Well, maybe you were more polite.

We're always listening for customers who say 'I wish I didn't have to do X' because that means we can make your life easier by doing X with a button.

Today we announce Batch's customizable dashboards, for your enjoyment :-)

If you have ideas for technical topics you'd like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by finding us on Twitter (@TechHpc) and DM'ing us with your idea.
