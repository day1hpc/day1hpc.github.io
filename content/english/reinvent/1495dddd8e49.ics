SUMMARY:CMP320: Accelerating semiconductor design\, simulation\, and verif
 ication

DESCRIPTION:AWS offers many solutions to design\, simulate\, and verify th
 e advanced semiconductor devices that are the foundation of modern technol
 ogy. Electronic design automation (EDA) workloads are critical to the succ
 ess of chip development. EDA requires computing for digital and analog sim
 ulations\, logic synthesis\, design rule checks\, and physical verificatio
 n. In this session\, discover best practices for running HPC or EDA worklo
 ads on AWS using Amazon EC2. Hear from Arm about how they use AWS to accel
 erate EDA workloads in the cloud using Arm-based AWS Graviton instances. A
 lso\, Marvell shares how theyâ€™re using EDA in the cloud to scale their h
 ighly differentiated cloud-optimized silicon solutions for customers like 
 AWS.
