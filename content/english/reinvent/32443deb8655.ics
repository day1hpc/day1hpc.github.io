SUMMARY:STG343: Deep dive on accelerating HPC and ML with Amazon FSx
DTSTART;TZID=US/Pacific:20221128T100000

DESCRIPTION:File services are often asked to deliver performant capabiliti
 es with low latencies for compute-intensive workloads or high IOPS for dat
 a-intensive applications. In this session\, learn best practices for choos
 ing how to rightsize your performance\, reduce latency\, increase throughp
 ut\, and optimize cost. The Amazon FSx family of managed file storage serv
 ices provides feature sets and performance profiles supporting a variety o
 f use cases. Many workloads like machine learning (ML)\, high performance 
 computing (HPC)\, video rendering\, and financial analytics require cost o
 ptimizations and deployment options. This session also shares tips and bes
 t practices for migrating performant-dependent use cases to AWS.
