SUMMARY:CMP325: Coding for multiple CPU architectures using lessons learne
 d in HPC

DESCRIPTION:This chalk talk details best practices and lessons learned abo
 ut coding for multiple architectures (x86 and AWS Graviton) from the last 
 ten years in the high performance computing (HPC) community. Amazon EC2 ha
 s seen a significant rise in the adoption of Arm-based AWS Graviton instan
 ces. When supporting multiple architectures\, itâ€™s important to ensure a
  consistent developer experience. When workloads run on multiple architect
 ures\, platform nuances and commonalities must be addressed to forge a tra
 nsparent developer environment. Come learn how HPC development techniques 
 can be applied to almost any compute workload and how to effectively code 
 for multiple compute infrastructure architectures.
