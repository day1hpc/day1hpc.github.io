SUMMARY:CMP222: Redefining Supercomputing on AWS
DTSTART;TZID=US/Pacific:20221130T194500
DTEND;TZID=US/Pacific:20221130T204500
DESCRIPTION:As the world strives to solve increasingly complex problems\, 
 single on-premises general-purpose supercomputers can fall short. In this 
 session\, you’ll learn how AWS is reimagining supercomputing to provide 
 scientists and engineers more access to world-class facilities and technol
 ogy. Whether it’s finding new life-saving drugs\, localizing natural dis
 aster prediction\, or designing airplanes powered by alternative energy so
 urces\, High Performance Computing (HPC) is transforming our lives. Nearly
  everything we use\, such as our cars and electronics\, are designed using
  supercomputers\, a class of HPC computing. Supercomputers divide a single
  problem across hundreds to thousands of servers to perform high-speed cal
 culations that reduce overall time to solution.
