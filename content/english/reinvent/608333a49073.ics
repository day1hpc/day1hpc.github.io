DESCRIPTION:Discover the power of combining traditional HPC simulations wi
 th AI/ML services to activate new workflows and scientific breakthroughs. 
 In this chalk talk\, learn about combined AWS HPC and ML solutions that ha
 ve evolved to state-of-the-art supercomputing models\, powered by AWS serv
 ices like Elastic Fabric Adapter\, AWS ParallelCluster\, Amazon EC2 instan
 ces\, Amazon FSx for Lustre\, and AWS Batch. Learn how AWS trained and dep
 loyed a new open-source PyTorch-based protein folding model called OpenFol
 d Single Sequence to accelerate drug discovery on AWS using HPC-grade dist
 ributed systems. Dive deep on technology innovations and architecture opti
 mizations for HPC-scale ML use cases.
