 en constrained by the need to purchase and deploy on-premises infrastructu
 re to gain access to the best technologies for their applications. AWS HPC
  helps you innovate beyond the limitations of on-premises HPC infrastructu
 re. In this talk\, see how to create and manage HPC environments with AWS 
 ParallelCluster\, access 400 Gbps networking with Elastic Fabric Adapter\,
