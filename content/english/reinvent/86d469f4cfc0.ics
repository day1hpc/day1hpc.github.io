SUMMARY:CMP205:Solve complex problems with pay-as-you-go infrastructure
DTSTART;TZID=US/Pacific:20221130T143000
DTEND;TZID=US/Pacific:20221130T153000
DESCRIPTION:In this session\, learn how high performance computing (HPC) o
 n AWS makes extreme-scale compute possible so that you can solve some of t
 he world’s toughest environmental\, social\, health\, and scientific pro
 blems. Learn about infrastructure that can help you design your products f
 aster with simulations\, predict the weather\, detect seismic activity wit
 h greater precision\, and much more. Discover how to run your massively pa
 rallel workloads and analyze more data with virtually unlimited infrastruc
 ture and nearly endless scale. Finally\, learn how you can simply turn it 
 off when you’re done and start it up when you’re ready to begin again\
 , helping you optimize your HPC costs.
