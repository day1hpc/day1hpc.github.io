DESCRIPTION:Imagine yourself as an aerodynamics engineer who uses computat
 ional fluid dynamics (CFD) to design new cars and planes\, and you want th
 e fastest turnaround times while retaining accuracy. This interactive chal
 k talk walks through techniques for optimizing complex workflows by combin
 ing AWS capabilities with optimization tricks to reduce simulation time fo
 r popular CFD codes such as OpenFOAM and Siemens Simcenter STAR-CCM+.
