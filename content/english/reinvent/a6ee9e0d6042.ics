SUMMARY:CMP331-R: High-throughput computing for financial risk management 
 and modeling
DTSTART;TZID=US/Pacific:20221128T100000

DESCRIPTION:In this chalk talk\, explore how financial services industry o
 rganizations can achieve greater elasticity\, higher throughput\, and sign
 ificant cost savings with a cloud-native high-throughput computing (HTC) g
 rid solution built on AWS core services. Using modular architecture made u
 p of managed services such as Amazon EKS\, Amazon DynamoDB\, Amazon SQS\, 
 and Amazon EC2 Spot Instances\, HTC grid solutions dynamically scale compu
 ting resources to meet the demanding throughput requirements of risk-analy
 tics workloads. Join the talk to learn about the modular architecture\, sc
 alability\, and performance you can achieve with this solution.
