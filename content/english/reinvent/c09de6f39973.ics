DESCRIPTION:For decades\, industries have been using high-performance comp
 uting (HPC) to solve problems that are not solvable on a single machine or
  to shorten problem-solving run time. Traditionally\, HPC workloads are la
 unched and managed on the master node\, which represents a single point of
  failure. Building HPC clusters on AWS allows you to keep the same user ex
 perience of launching\, monitoring\, and managing an HPC workload. In this
  chalk talk\, learn how to launch\, monitor\, and manage an HPC workload u
 sing native AWS services\, following a seismic processing problem as an ex
 ample.
