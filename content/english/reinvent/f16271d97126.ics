DESCRIPTION:In this chalk talk\, learn about a new physics-informed neural
  network (PINNs) framework for simulations on PyTorch for fast-to-compute 
 and highly accurate models for various applications. The computational cos
 t associated with multi-physics simulations often impose serious limitatio
 ns for design space exploration\, optimization\, and uncertainty quantific
 ation. Learn how to apply methods for solving partial differential equatio
 ns that govern the physics of engineering systems using PINNs and other re
 levant applications in engineering. This was developed and implemented by 
 AWS in collaboration with the University of Central Florida.
