DESCRIPTION:In this chalk talk\, learn how to efficiently and cost-effecti
 vely run your high-scale\, compute-intensive workloads using the capabilit
 ies of AWS Batch. Scaling containers for batch workloads like machine lear
 ning training\, simulations\, and large dataset processing in a timely fas
 hion is challenging. AWS Batch is a fully managed service for orchestratin
 g AWS compute resources for batch processing or parallel computing at any 
 scale. AWS Batch can schedule\, orchestrate\, and run your jobs on contain
 er-based clusters and automatically scale resources to match your job requ
 irements.
