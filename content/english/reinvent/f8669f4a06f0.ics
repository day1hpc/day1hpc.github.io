SUMMARY:ENU401: Ephemeral HPC to accelerate energy and utility workflows
DTSTART;TZID=US/Pacific:20221129T131500

DESCRIPTION:Energy and utility companies use high performance computing (H
 PC) to design and optimize operations. Elastic\, cloud-based HPC resources
  can dynamically provide the computational power needed for simulations on
  demand by creating reusable pipelines. HPC on AWS can be instantiated wit
 h the nodes and memory to optimize turnaround time while keeping the resul
 ts sufficiently accurate. This allows you to make decisions about tradeoff
 s between cost\, run time\, and accuracy resolution based on your organiza
 tionâ€™s priorities. This chalk talk explores how to create HPC using infr
 astructure as code with AWS CloudFormation\, Amazon EC2 Image Builder\, Am
 azon FSx for Lustre\, and inherited IAM permissions.
