DESCRIPTION:It may seem like science fiction\, but quantum computing is he
 re—and it’s available on the AWS Cloud. Although production workloads 
 aren’t available yet\, Amazon Braket gives you the ability to get quantu
 m-ready by exploring the capabilities of a range of current quantum hardwa
 re\, including superconducting qubits\, ion traps\, photonic qubits\, and 
 Rydberg atom arrays\, with more being added regularly. Join this session f
 or an introduction to quantum computing\, learn about how the Braket servi
 ce works\, and hear AWS Partners discuss the novel solutions they’ve bui
 lt on Braket.
