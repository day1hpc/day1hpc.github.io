DESCRIPTION:Over the last few years\, machine learning (ML)\, more specifi
 cally deep learning (DL)\, has become important for the HPC community. DL 
 uses frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch\, which use underlying hardwar
 e features for better performance. In this session\, learn about how DL fr
 ameworks use ML-specific Arm architecture features like BFloat16 for faste
 r inference on AWS Graviton3 compared to other platforms.
