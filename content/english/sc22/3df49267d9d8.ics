SUMMARY:Heterogeneous HPC workflows with Covalent on AWS
DTSTART;TZID=America/Chicago:20221115T100000

DESCRIPTION:Covalent is an open-source Pythonic tool for heterogeneous wor
 kflows (HPC and quantum)\, designed specifically to make computational res
 earch more scalable\, manageable\, and reproducible. Covalent provides a r
 ich and intuitive browser-based interface that empowers users to visualize
  and interact with their workflows. Covalent integrates with a number of A
 WS cloud services that allow users to dispatch their workflows for remote 
 execution on diverse compute backends. Using Covalent AWS plugins\, users 
 can prototype\, iterate and rapidly optimize their workflows. Users can al
 so self-host Covalent within their own AWS infrastructure. This demo highl
 ights several use cases where Covalent can be used in conjunction with AWS
  compute resources.
