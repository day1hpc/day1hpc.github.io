 e cloud

DESCRIPTION:In this demo\, learn how the QEMIST Cloud platform combines AW
 S cloud infrastructure\; compute and managed services like Amazon EC2\, Am
 azon EKS\, and Amazon Aurora\; and the recently announced high-performance
  scaling service Karpenter to build a massively parallel multi-cluster sup
 ercomputer for chemistry applications. The computing power of this platfor
 m was tested by using it to solve a record-breaking near-exact simulation 
 of Decacene (a molecule with ~200 active electrons in ~600 orbitals) in on
 ly 11 hours at merely $2K in cloud costs. This demo shows how cloud comput
 ing and the latest developments in AI and quantum computing are shaping th
 e future of high-performance simulations for chemistry\, advanced material
 s\, and drug discovery.
