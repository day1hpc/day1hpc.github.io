SUMMARY:Programming and benchmarking AWS Graviton for HPC
DTSTART;TZID=America/Chicago:20221116T113000
DTEND;TZID=America/Chicago:20221116T120000
DESCRIPTION:The Arm-based AWS Graviton2 and AWS Graviton3 processors avail
 able on AWS offer high core-counts\, high memory-bandwidth\, and high floa
 ting-point performance. This session shares experiences with benchmarking 
 these processors for HPC-style codes. In addition to lower-level testing o
 f memory bandwidth and latency\, learn about multi-node performance for la
 rger applications\, including benchmarks from SPEChpc. Also\, explore prog
 ramming these Arm-based processors using a diverse range of the latest par
 allel programming models and many major open-source and vendor compilers\,
  including standard parallelism in C++ and Fortran.
