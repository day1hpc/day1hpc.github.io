SUMMARY:Enabling high-performance research with Service Workbench on AWS
DTSTART;TZID=America/Chicago:20221115T163000

DESCRIPTION:Organizations in the healthcare and life sciences domain have 
 several applications for on-demand cloud computing. Genome sequencing\, cl
 inical trial simulations\, and analysis of therapeutic compounds require a
  scalable\, secure\, and on-demand computing environment. Service Workbenc
 h on AWS is an open-source solution that enables IT teams to create secure
  portals for researchers on AWS\, which combine data management\, research
  tools\, and cost visibility without requiring researchers to use the AWS 
 console. In this session\, learn about the goals of Service Workbench on A
 WS and the architecture for HPC customers\, see a demo of a Service Workbe
 nch HPC prototype with AWS ParallelCluster integration\, and hear about th
 e roadmap for 2022 and beyond.
