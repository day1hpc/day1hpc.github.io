DESCRIPTION:While researchers are increasingly using cloud computing offer
 ings\, many aren’t experienced with system administration or cloud servi
 ce management. This can be challenging for groups without cloud specialist
 s to manage infrastructure and may reduce cloud engagement. Since 2020\, t
 he Advanced Research Computing team at the University of British Columbia 
 (UBC) has been using RONIN to deliver a full-service cloud offering to the
 ir research community. Come learn about their community\, the challenges t
 hey faced\, and the lessons they learned with the cloud while using the us
 er interfaces on AWS. Hear about their experience with RONIN\, what resear
 chers can expect with RONIN\, and what’s required to create a workflow i
 n a cloud environment.
