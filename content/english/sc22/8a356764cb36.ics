SUMMARY:Windows VDI Solution for HPC Users
DTSTART;TZID=America/Chicago:20221116T130000
DTEND;TZID=America/Chicago:20221116T150000
DESCRIPTION:Engineers are using HPC simulations to accelerate the time nee
 ded to design and validate new products. To achieve this goal\, they need 
 not only to run HPC simulations faster but also to easily modify the input
  files and visualize the results using their preferred CAD and post-proces
 sing software that usually runs on the Windows OS. This demo covers a Wind
 ows VDI solution that can create the infrastructure for your users to auth
 enticate and connect to virtual Windows sessions with Amazon AppStream 2.0
 \, submit their HPC jobs to a Linux cluster\, and view the output files as
  they are being written out on an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system.
