DESCRIPTION:Whether you are training large machine learning models or runn
 ing genomic sequencing\, EDA\, video encoding\, big data processing\, or a
 utonomous vehicle simulation workloads in the cloud\, youâ€™re going to ne
 ed cloud-native scheduling and orchestration. In this session\, learn abou
 t AWS Batch\, a container-centric\, fully managed service for job schedule
  and AWS compute resource orchestration. Dive deep into AWS Batch major co
 mponents\, such as job definition\, job queues\, job states\, compute envi
 ronments\, instance selection\, job throughput\, and allocation strategies
 . Also\, discover best practices that can help you build optimized AWS Bat
 ch architectures and run AWS Batch at scale.
