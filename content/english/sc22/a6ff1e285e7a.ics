DESCRIPTION:CryoElectron Microscopy (CryoEM) is revolutionizing the field 
 of structure-based drug design by representing protein structures at that 
 resolutions that are needed for drug discovery. However\, CryoEM analysis 
 workflow provides unique challenges for data handling\, compute availabili
 ty\, automation\, and orchestration. In this demo\, learn how Clovertexâ€™
 s cloud-based scientific discovery platform for structural biologists offe
 rs single-click deployment in your VPC so you can scalably and affordably 
 store and process cryoEM data in the cloud. The platform uses 30+ AWS serv
 ices and brings together the learnings from extensive benchmarking. Empowe
 r your scientists to focus on science by reducing cost of analysis and ana
 lyzing more structures in a short amount of time.
