DESCRIPTION:Education institutions increasingly use AWS for research\, par
 ticularly for complex workflows and HTC/HPC workloads. Researchers recogni
 ze that the flexibility\, breadth of tools\, resources\, and services offe
 red by AWS provide access to environments that meet their needs on their s
 chedules\, but they donâ€™t want to spend time learning about computationa
 l infrastructure. This session illustrates how researchers and institution
 s can accelerate AWS adoption through curated guidance from the AWS resear
 ch group. Topics include guides and preconfigured AWS tools like AWS Paral
 lelCluster\, explainers for software like MATLAB and libraries like Dask t
 hat support AWS natively\, institutional engagements for on-premises burst
 ing to AWS\, research-focused services like Amazon Lightsail and Amazon Sa
 geMaker Studio Lab\, and proposal development.
