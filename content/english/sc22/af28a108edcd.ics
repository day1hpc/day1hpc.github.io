DESCRIPTION:Research Gateway provides a Self-Service UI Portal (SaaS and E
 nterprise models) for Researchers to provision\, run analysis and manage c
 osts of complex HPC architecture on AWS with great simplicity. The solutio
 n allows users to create an HPC powered MyResearch Cloud in less than 30 m
 in from a standard catalog\, with ability to add your own tools. Built on 
 AWS Parallel Cluster with intelligent cost tracking\, automation blueprint
 s for workload migrations and project-based data collaboration\, researche
 rs can focus on Science and Research Grants funding controls without need 
 for any AWS Console access. Central IT can easily extend the self-service 
 models to a large group of researchers with in-built governance controls a
 nd billing for chargebacks.
