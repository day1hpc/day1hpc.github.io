SUMMARY:CLASSIQ: Quantum software at a higher level

DESCRIPTION:It's relatively easy to explain how popular quantum algorithms
  work - how to perform a Grover search\, how to optimize an asset portfoli
 o\, how to analyze credit risks\, and even how Shor's algorithm works. It 
 is much more difficult\, however\, to implement these algorithms in a gene
 ralized way\, to allow them to run at scale\, and code them in an efficien
 t and hardware-aware way. Come see our demo and experience a radically bet
 ter way to develop quantum software. Our platform automatically creates op
 timized and hardware-aware circuits from high-level functional models. It 
 automates and simplifies the difficult process of creating quantum algorit
 hms allowing you to create 100+ qubit software in minutes.
