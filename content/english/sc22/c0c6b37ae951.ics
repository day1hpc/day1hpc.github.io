DESCRIPTION:Multiverse Computing—a leading deep-tech company developing 
 quantum software—has developed Singularity Optimization\, a Python libra
 ry used for modeling and solving generic optimization problems with quantu
 m and quantum-inspired solvers. Optimization is one of the most promising 
 use cases for quantum computing\, which offers a way to move beyond the li
 mitations of conventional computers. Multiverse and commercial quantum har
 dware providers demonstrate already today that real-life industrial optimi
 zation problems can be solved efficiently by quantum means. In this demo\,
  learn about numerous examples of Singularity Optimization at work on AWS\
 , and dive into a straightforward interface that requires no prior quantum
  experience or knowledge.
