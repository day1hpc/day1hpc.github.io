SUMMARY:High Fidelity Ray Tracing with Intel oneAPI Rendering Toolkit and 
 NICE DCV

DESCRIPTION:Ray tracing for scientific data provides efficient and realist
 ic lighting and materials for enhanced visual analysis. Recent advances in
  hardware and software now provide interactive ray tracing on both CPU and
  GPU platforms. To fully exploit interactive ray tracing in remote computi
 ng contexts\, researchers require a performant framework that provides an 
 interactive experience even in high latency and low bandwidth contexts. Th
 is chalk talk presents how the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) uses
  NICE DCV and the Intel oneAPI Rendering Toolkit to provide interactive vi
 sual analysis.
