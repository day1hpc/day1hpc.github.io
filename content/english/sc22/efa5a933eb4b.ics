DESCRIPTION:In this session\, learn about the benefits of running Altair R
 adioss on Amazon EC2 Hpc6a instances powered by third-generation AMD EPYC 
 processors. For numerous\, diverse industries worldwide\, Radioss is a ver
 satile and comprehensive high-performance explicit finite element (FE) sol
 ver\, based on solid and fluid dynamics. It is a standard\, go-to tool to 
 accurately predict dynamic\, transient-loading effects on structures and p
 roducts to improve safety and survivability and to design more robust prod
 ucts. Radioss on Hpc6a instances delivers impressive performance on premis
 es. Discover the scaling and performance improvements achieved from Radios
 s running on Hpc6a instances.
