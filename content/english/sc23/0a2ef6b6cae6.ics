DESCRIPTION:Training machine learning (ML) models requires setting up clus
 ters that enable many GPUs to talk to each other using low-latency network
 ing that is capable of driving massive throughput. This session shares in 
 real time how you can quickly and easily set up an ML training cluster usi
 ng AWS ParallelCluster\, NVIDIA GPUs\, Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA)\, and 
 Amazon FSx for Lustre. Learn how to train a GPT model using Megatron-LM\, 
 store the results\, and collapse the infrastructure when youâ€™re finished
 .
