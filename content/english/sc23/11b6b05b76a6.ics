SUMMARY:Scaling AI and generative AI workloads with Covalent

DESCRIPTION:As focus shifts from data-centric to compute-intensive tasks\,
  many traditional cloud tools struggle to maintain efficiency and scalabil
 ity. Built on AWS\, Covalent provides developer-friendly abstractions for 
 high-compute workloads. Users can integrate their own AWS Batch jobs for c
 omputing while Covalent takes care of orchestration to maintain data priva
 cy. The framework harnesses AWS services such as Amazon SQS\, Amazon Event
 Bridge\, and AWS Lambda to enhance scalability and cost-efficiency. Covale
 nt optimizes costs and simplifies development\, making compute-intensive t
 asks feel like an extension of one‚Äôs local laptop. This demo delves 
 into Covalent‚Äôs unique positioning in meeting the demands of high-co
 mpute developments\, including large language models (AIs) and generative 
 AI.
