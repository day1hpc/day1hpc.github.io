SUMMARY:Powering hybrid cloud workloads with YellowDog and AWS

DESCRIPTION:Compute availability is the biggest challenge with most worklo
 ads (including AI and ML) now chasing constrained global capacity. The imp
 erative is to think and act quickly to get what you need but be smart\, be
  efficient\, and reduce risk. On-premises resources are still very much pa
 rt of the equation\, and\, combined with the huge global cloud footprint o
 f AWS\, YellowDog uniquely enables workload portability at scale efficient
 ly and cost effectively\, reducing operational risk and accelerating insig
 ht.
