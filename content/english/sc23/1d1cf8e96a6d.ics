SUMMARY:Zero to Hero: Conquering the Arm Neoverse (Arm HPC User group tuto
 rial)

DESCRIPTION:Arm technology has increasingly become a compelling choice for
  HPC due to its promise of higher efficiency\, density\, scalability\, and
  broad ecosystem of software. Arm expansion in the datacentre started in 2
 018 with Arm Neoverse\, a set of infrastructure CPU IPs designed for high-
 end computing. The Arm-based Fugaku supercomputer\, first of its kind impl
 ementing Arm SVE instruction set\, entered the Top 500 in June 2020 scorin
 g at the top and retaining a leadership position over the years not only i
 n HPL but also for HPCG (where it is still unbeaten). This event has been 
 a wake-up call for the HPC community. The datacentre and HPC space have lo
 ng been dominated by x86 CPUs. There is a growing interest in diversifying
  and exploring new architectures to re-create a vibrant and diverse ecosys
 tem of architectures as it was more than a decade ago. Arm technology is a
 t the forefront of this wave of change. This tutorial welcomes scientists 
 and engineers interested in running a variety of workloads on a Arm-based 
 system\, either on-premises or in the cloud. The tutorial will guide the a
 ttendee through compile\, execute\, profile and optimize codes for Arm to 
 demystify those claims that changing CPU architecture is hard.
