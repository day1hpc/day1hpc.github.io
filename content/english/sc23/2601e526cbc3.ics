DESCRIPTION:Training AI (ML) models requires setting up clusters that enab
 le many GPUs to talk to each other using low-latency networking that is ca
 pable of driving massive throughput. This session shares in real time how 
 you can quickly and easily set up an ML training cluster using AWS Paralle
 lCluster\, NVIDIA GPUs\, Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA)\, and Amazon FSx for
  Lustre. Learn how to train a GPT model using Megatron-LM\, store the resu
 lts\, and collapse the infrastructure when youâ€™re finished.
