DESCRIPTION:The MATLAB Support Package for Quantum Computing lets you buil
 d\, simulate\, and run quantum algorithms on real quantum hardware through
  Amazon Braket. In this demo\, explore how you can use the support package
  within the MATLAB environment to 1/ build circuits and implement quantum 
 algorithms using a variety of built-in and customizable composite gates\; 
 2/ verify the implementations with local simulators in MATLAB or simulator
 s hosted on Amazon Braket\; 3/ run the algorithms on quantum computers usi
 ng Amazon Braket\; and 4/ visualize\, analyze\, and plot results. See how 
 the support package allows you to prototype algorithms to accelerate optim
 ization\, scenario simulation\, and ML\, in addition to helping you solve 
 currently unsolvable problems in chemistry and material simulations.
