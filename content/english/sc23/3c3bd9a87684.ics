DESCRIPTION:The Fugaku supercomputer has made substantial strides in compu
 tational capability and user accessibility by integrating a robust system 
 software stack involving HPC\, Big Data\, AI\, and more than 50 HPC produc
 tivity applications and tools preinstalled and maintained ready-to-use and
  accessible through a robust GUI environment. As developer and owner of Fu
 gaku\, RIKEN Center for Computational Science (R-CCS) continues developmen
 t of Virtual Fugaku\, an initiative aimed at seamlessly extending the soft
 ware environment of Fugaku to a broader user base and packaged into a cont
 ainerized portable software distribution. In this session\, learn how R-CC
 S and AWS are working together to deliver the full capability of Fugaku on
 to a virtual cluster on the AWS Cloud using AWS Graviton3 and AWS Graviton
 3E Arm-based cloud infrastructure. This integration highlights Fugaku's ve
 rsatility and AWS's commitment to embrace cutting-edge technologies in the
  realm of HPC and high-end AI.
