DESCRIPTION:High-throughput computing (HTC) is emerging as a powerful capa
 bility for engineering and research across many industries. From drug disc
 overy and computational chemistry to electronic design automation (EDA) an
 d environmental research\, HTC is helping scientific and engineering teams
  perform massively parallel processing to quickly analyze vast quantities 
 of information for solving some of the world‚Äôs most complex scientif
 ic and engineering challenges. In this demo\, see how companies like Arm u
 se the Rescale HTC platform powered by services like AWS Batch and AWS Gra
 viton3E-based Amazon EC2 instances to run large-scale analyses for semicon
 ductor design.
