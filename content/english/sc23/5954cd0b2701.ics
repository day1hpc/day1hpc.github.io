DESCRIPTION:Deloitte used QuEra‚Äôs neutral atom system to classify ma
 nufacturing images at their Smart Factory in Wichita\, Kansas. In this dem
 o\, see how Deloitte took a real-world business problem\, solved it with c
 utting-edge quantum AI techniques (quantum reservoir computing)\, and prod
 uctionized it using a production-ready dashboard. Deloitte compared QuEra
 ‚Äôs implementation of quantum reservoir computing against classical m
 ethodologies and found the results exceeded the method currently being use
 d. Learn how Deloitte is working to productionize quantum AI algorithms as
  part of The Smart Factory quality assurance efforts and are working with 
 the team to find the best methods for performing these tasks in a manufact
 uring facility.
