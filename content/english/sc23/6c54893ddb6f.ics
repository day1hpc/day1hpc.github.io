DESCRIPTION:Companies and talent alike are catching on to quantum computin
 g. Companies are racing to build quantum computers with the most qubits\, 
 and people\, from business leaders to students and job seekers\, are looki
 ng to join the industry. However\, a challenge is that today‚Äôs quant
 um computers are noisy and prone to error\, which affects the accuracy of 
 everything they attempt to do. This is what Q-CTRL is solving. Q-CTRL‚Ä
 ôs mission is to make quantum technology useful. This demo showcases how 
 Q-CTRL infrastructure software is delivering business advantage from quant
 um computing. Q-CTRL builds commercial-ready\, quantum control and error r
 eduction products available on the AWS Marketplace and integrated with Ama
