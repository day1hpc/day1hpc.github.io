DESCRIPTION:Amazon FSx for Lustre helps you deploy high-performance Lustre
  systems in just a few clicks and has capabilities that most traditional s
 torage systems lack—think of processing hundreds of gigabytes per second
  of throughput without months of planning\, logistics\, and testing. In th
 is session\, learn how to spin up a large-scale and fast Lustre file syste
 m in less time than it takes to make a coffee. Then\, discover how it can 
 synchronize with massive datasets in object storage and how you can choose
  from different classes of storage performance and price to match your org
 anization’s needs. Finally\, learn how you can use Amazon File Cache to 
 deploy Lustre as a massively parallel cloud cache for storage systems in y
 our own data centers and how this can be a useful tool for creating hybrid
  facilities that speed up your users’ time to results.
