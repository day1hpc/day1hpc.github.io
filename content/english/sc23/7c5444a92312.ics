SUMMARY:Accelerate HPC workloads with Amazon EC2\, powered by AMD EPYC pro
 cessors

DESCRIPTION:Amazon EC2 Hpc7a instances\, powered by fourth-generation AMD 
 EPYC processors\, deliver up to 2.5 times better performance compared to A
 mazon EC2 Hpc6a instances. Hpc7a instances feature 2 times higher core den
 sity (up to 192 cores)\, 2.1 times higher memory bandwidth throughput\, 2 
 times memory (768 GB)\, and 3 times higher network bandwidth compared to H
 pc6a instances. In this demonstration\, explore how Hpc7a instances are de
 signed to run your tightly coupled HPC workloads\, such as computational f
 luid dynamics\, weather forecasting\, and multiphysics simulations\, with 
 better performance.
