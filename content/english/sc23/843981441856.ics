 at develops consumer-tech products‚Äîlet‚Äôs call it TC-Anonymous 
 (TCA). After moving several engineering simulations at TCA to AWS\, UberCl
 oud built its first automated self-service engineering simulation producti
 on platform on AWS and onboarded the first seven engineers of TCA‚Äôs 
 R&D department to AWS. Today\, TCA is running 34 different simulation work
 flows on AWS\, with annual cloud consumption of $15 million\, and increasi
 ng engineers‚Äô productivity by a factor of 10 to 40\, depending on th
 e scalability of the simulation jobs and the cloud HPC hardware. In the AW
