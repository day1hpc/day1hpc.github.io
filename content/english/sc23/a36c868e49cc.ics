DESCRIPTION:HPC systems deployed on AWS often rely on various resources li
 ke file systems\, networking\, and directory services. Despite AWS Paralle
 lCluster’s automation capabilities\, setting up and integrating these de
 pendencies can become complex if you have a lot of custom requirements. In
  this session\, walk through how the new HPC Recipes for AWS library simpl
 ifies this process. Then\, learn how to create a multi-user environment\, 
 configure shared storage\, set up a budget\, and deploy a benchmarking clu
 ster with just a few clicks in the AWS Management Console. Finally\, disco
 ver how to combine\, modify\, and reuse these recipes to meet your particu
 lar needs—without needing to be an AWS expert.
