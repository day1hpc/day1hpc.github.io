DESCRIPTION:In this demonstration\, learn about the Parallel Works single 
 pane of glass\, multicloud environment operated by General Dynamics Inform
 ation Technology for NOAA‚Äôs research and development HPC organizatio
 n. Learn about key aspects of the implementation and optimization of the p
 latform for large-scale HPC-driven research and development. The Parallel 
 Works platform uses more than 20 AWS services\, including Amazon FSx for L
 ustre\, Amazon S3\, Amazon EC2\, and Amazon EFS. Dive deep on the end user
  experience\, which incorporates the familiar on-premises computing enviro
 nment and the flexibility and innovation of the cloud. Explore the portabi
 lity of this environment to the multicloud environment and how it bridges 
 the cloud to NOAA‚Äôs on-premises HPC resources. Discover how this env
 ironment supports AI operations that are critical to the evolution of envi
 ronmental prediction at NOAA.
