DESCRIPTION:The generative capability of AI holds significant promise acro
 ss a diverse range of industries fueled by engineering design\, such as au
 tomotive\, motor sports\, and aerospace. In this session\, discover how to
  create a pipeline that uses generative AI designs to feed conventional ph
 ysics-based simulations\, and learn how to loop all of this to create a co
 nverging\, rapid design process for exploring new design concepts starting
  from a single image. Learn how to use open source frameworks to create di
 gital twins\, deploy OpenFOAM in containers for the simulations\, and use 
 serverless tools coupled with AWS Batch to drive all this at scale.
