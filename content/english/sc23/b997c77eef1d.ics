DESCRIPTION:AWS Trainium purpose-built accelerators can be used to train l
 arge language models (LLMs) such as Llama 2. AWS Neuron is the SDK used to
  run deep learning workloads on AWS Trainiumâ€“based instances. It integra
 tes the AI framework\, such as PyTorch or TensorFlow\, with the hardware t
 o enable end-to-end ML development\, including building new models and tra
 ining and scaling these models. The AWS Neuron SDK supports multiple distr
 ibuted libraries using tensor parallelism\, pipeline parallelism\, and seq
 uence parallelism for large-scale training. In this session\, find out how
  to use AWS ParallelCluster to launch Amazon EC2 Trn1 instances and train 
 a Llama 2 model (up to 70B) on more than 1\,000 chips.
