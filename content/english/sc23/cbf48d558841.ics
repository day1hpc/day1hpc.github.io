DESCRIPTION:Promethium is a revolutionary chemistry simulation platform de
 veloped by QC Ware that will significantly accelerate the drug\, material\
 , and chemical discovery process. Built for virtually unlimited scalabilit
 y on Amazon EC2 P3 and P4d instances\, Promethium was designed to be GPU n
 ative and perform fully ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculat
 ions with exceptional speed and accuracy. Coupled with its capability to t
 reat system sizes not typically accessible by DFT\, Promethium has the pot
 ential to transform the industry and bring immediate value to customers in
  areas like pharma and materials science. Whether you‚Äôre trying to d
 iscover the next blockbuster drug or developing more advanced materials\, 
 join this session to learn how Promethium can help you make breakthrough d
 iscoveries and take your research to the next level.
