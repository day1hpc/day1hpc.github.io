DESCRIPTION:With quantum computing increasingly moving toward practical ap
 plications\, the need for user-friendly and highly integrated platforms ha
 s never been greater. This session presents how the powerful integration b
 etween Classiq and Amazon Braket streamlines the user experience\, from qu
 antum circuit design to implementation. Learn how this integration elimina
 tes the complexities of using and integrating quantum computers\, allowing
  you to focus on solving real-world problems.
