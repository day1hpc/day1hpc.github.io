SUMMARY:Amazon Braket Tutorial ("Solving Optimization Problems Using Near 
 Term Quantum Devices")Â 
DTSTART;TZID=America/Denver:20231113T083000

DESCRIPTION:Optimization problems are among the most promising quantum app
 lications that combine the use of quantum processor and classical processo
 rs. This tutorial is aimed at teaching the participants to solve optimizat
 ion problems using two distinct quantum computing paradigms: (i) hybrid qu
 antum-classical algorithms using gate-based systems\, and (ii) neutral ato
 m analog Hamiltonian simulations device. In gate-based systems\, a paramet
 erized quantum circuit is designed which is then used to compute value of 
 an objective function and iteratively optimize via classical optimization 
 algorithms. Such hybrid algorithms rely on rapid iterative computations of
  quantum and classical processors\, requiring regular sharing of data betw
 een them. The analog Hamiltonian simulation quantum device comprises of an
  array of two-level neutral Rydberg atoms with ground state and excited Ry
 dberg state. The atoms can be arranged in any 1D or 2D geometry and initia
 lly prepared in the ground state. The parameters of the driving Hamiltonia
 n are then adiabatically varied and the state of each neutral atom is meas
 ured which represents the final solution. The tutorial will provide introd
 uction to quantum computing and demonstrate the aforementioned solutions u
 sing hand-on sessions provided via free cloud access to quantum hardware.
