SUMMARY:Women in HPC Workshop
DTSTART;TZID=America/Denver:20231113T090000
DTEND;TZID=America/Denver:20231113T170000
DESCRIPTION:The WHPC workshop aims to raise awareness and address issues a
 round diversity and inclusion within the HPC community and workforce. Lack
  of diversity in the workforce is a challenge that the entire supercomputi
 ng industry faces. Research shows that diverse teams have increased produc
 tivity\, creativity\, problem-solving\, and scientific output. Thus\, addr
 essing the lack of diversity should be as important to the community as re
 aching exascale. The HPC community is only just beginning to measure how 
 ‘leaky’ our pipeline is\; particularly for women\, attrition rates lik
 ely align with the general tech community figures: 41% of women working in
  tech eventually end up leaving the field (compared to just 17% of men).\n
 \nTraditionally\, our workshop series has focused on gender diversity and 
 issues primarily facing women. This year\, we aim to increase the emphasis
  on diversity and inclusion of both women and men from underrepresented gr
 oups. This workshop is a key step in addressing one aspect of the underrep
 resentation of various minorities: helping to retain diverse employees in 
 the field and providing them with the tools to prosper and excel.\n
