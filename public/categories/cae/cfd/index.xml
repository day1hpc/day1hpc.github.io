      <description>In this blog post, we discuss the AWS solution that Amazon’s construction division used to conduct large-scale CFD fire simulations as part of their Fire Strategy solutions to demonstrate safety and fire mitigation strategies. We outline the five key steps taken that resulted in simulation times that were 15-20x faster than previous on-premises architectures, reducing the time to complete from up to twenty-one days to less than one day.

      <description>OpenFOAM is one the most widely used Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) packages and helps companies in a broad range of sectors (automotive, aerospace, energy, and life-sciences) to conduct research and design new products. In this post, we’ll discuss six practical things you can do as an OpenFOAM user to run your simulations faster and more cost effectively.

      <title>CFD performance on Ice Lake CPU with the Amazon EC2 C6i (Part 2)</title>
      <link>https://d175uvn6dnkepf.cloudfront.net/post/cfd-performance-on-ice-lake-cpu-with-the-amazon-ec2-c6i-part-2.html</link>

      <guid>https://d175uvn6dnkepf.cloudfront.net/post/cfd-performance-on-ice-lake-cpu-with-the-amazon-ec2-c6i-part-2.html</guid>
      <description>Today we launched the new Amazon EC2 C6i instance family which is powered by the Intel Xeon Ice Lake processor and comes equipped with our Elastic Fabric Adapter.
Neil Ashton and Nicola Venuti joined us to talk about CFD performance on this new instance family, and spent some time comparing network connectivity options, too.
This is a two part series of Tech Shorts:
Part 1) Discuss C6i and how it&amp;rsquo;s put together. Look at OpenFOAM and Siemens Simcenter StarCCM+ Part 2) Ansys Fluent, under populated cores, and some on-premises comparisons for calibration.
If you have ideas for technical topics you&amp;rsquo;d like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by finding us on Twitter (@TechHpc) and DM&amp;rsquo;ing us with your idea.</description>

      <description>Running HPC workloads, like computational fluid dynamics (CFD), molecular dynamics, or weather forecasting typically involves a lot of moving parts. You need a hundreds or thousands of compute cores, a job scheduler for keeping them fed, a shared file system that’s tuned for throughput or IOPS (or both), loads of libraries, a fast network, and […]
