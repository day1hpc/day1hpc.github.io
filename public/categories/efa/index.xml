      <description>Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) The AWS Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) is a high-performance networking interface for Amazon EC2 instances that enables you to run applications requiring high levels of inter-node communications at scale on AWS.
It&amp;rsquo;s natively supported by Intel MPI, Open MPI, MVAPICH, and NCCL and is available on across CPU and GPU architectures including our own AWS Graviton processors.
How does it work? Amazon EC2 compute infrastructure is very much not like a ‘normal’ supercomputer (whatever that is). We don’t start with a blank page every few years and design the next big system. It’s a little more like a city where we build on what’s there already, renovate occasionally, and push for bigger and better and faster, while keeping the lights on and the traffic flowing at all times.
While this leads to different design decisions, it also leads to interesting discoveries.</description>
