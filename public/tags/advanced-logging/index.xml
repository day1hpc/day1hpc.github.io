      <description>The AWS Batch team recently added container insights and advanced logging features to the Batch console, which is making a LOT of people very happy.
We decided to catch up with the dev team in Seattle who worked on this, and one of my favotire Amazonians - David Chambers - joined me to help us all understand what this means to Batch users and to taker us for a drive to sere how easy it is.
This is our first ever in-person Tech Short, which is something we&amp;rsquo;re really keen to build on, now that travel is starting to happen more. Hope you like it.
If you have ideas for technical topics you&amp;rsquo;d like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by finding us on Twitter (@TechHpc) and DM&amp;rsquo;ing us with your idea.</description>
