      <description>Slurm&amp;rsquo;s job management API, coupled with ParallelCluster&amp;rsquo;s own API for managing cluster infrastructure opens up a lot of doors to create new ways for your users to interact with HPC resources - in this case without having to leave their familiar Jupyter notebook environment.
We made this video as part of the launch of ParallelCluster 3 - we want to make it easy to migrate all your workflows from to Slurm, and we figured it would be easier if you heard abotu it from the source.
So we enlisted the help of SchedMD&amp;rsquo;s Director of Cloud Engineering, Nick Ihli to help us show you how it&amp;rsquo;s a lot easier than it might look.
Joining Nick today is Josiah Bjorgaard from the AWS APN Solution Architecture team, who regularly works with Nick and the team from SchedMD to solve lots of customer problems.</description>
