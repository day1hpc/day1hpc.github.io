      <description>Netflix has a really ambitious goal to create more content than practically anyone, but ran into headwinds when Covid-19 forced us all to lock down: it became hard to recruit and support artists, editors and other creatives without finding some really clever solutions to putting powerful compute at their fingertips anywhere in the world : a perfect job for AWS&amp;rsquo;s NICE DCV and globally-distributed infrastructure.
But there&amp;rsquo;s another lesson here - when you listen to how Michelle describes the way Netflix works to support their most valuable assets (clever, talented people), it should strike you as a really good lesson for how we should prosecute our mission to make scientists and engineers more powerful and productive with all these same tools.
You can find Michelle on linkedIn (linkedin.com/in/michellebrenner/) if you want to know more, or you can join her working at Netflix by heading to job.</description>
