      <description>This is a talk that was delivered at the AWS/Arm Cloud Hackathon in July 2021.
Will Lovett works for Arm on the Arm compiler, and talk about how compilers work, and how to best leverage them to get the result you&amp;rsquo;re looking for when porting a code or working on performance.
The Summer Hackathon ran for a week from July 12-16 in 2021. It&amp;rsquo;s purpose was to assemble the HPC community around a common goal of beginning the porting/testing/tuning process for dozens of codes to use Arm-based processors, in this case, AWS&amp;rsquo;s Graviton2&amp;rsquo;s.
During the week we had a series of talks from global leaders and experts in various fields from compilers to networking, profiling debugging and tooling. We&amp;rsquo;ve published all the talks here in the HPC Tech Shorts channel, in the hope that everyone gets some value from them.</description>
