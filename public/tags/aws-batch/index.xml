      <description>The AWS Batch team recently added container insights and advanced logging features to the Batch console, which is making a LOT of people very happy.
We decided to catch up with the dev team in Seattle who worked on this, and one of my favotire Amazonians - David Chambers - joined me to help us all understand what this means to Batch users and to taker us for a drive to sere how easy it is.
This is our first ever in-person Tech Short, which is something we&amp;rsquo;re really keen to build on, now that travel is starting to happen more. Hope you like it.

      <description>The AWS Genomics CLI (or AGC) seriously removes all the grunt work involved in setting up bioinformatics pipelines to run in the cloud. We know that Snakemake, Cromwell, NextFlow and miniWDL all work happily in the cloud on AWS Batch, but AGC means you don&amp;rsquo;t have to know to set all that stuff up - it does it for you.
You can have completely separate tool chains using completely different workflow languages all running at the same time, on the same infrastructure (if you like), sharing data and tooling.
Lee Pang from the dev team that built this came along to show us how it works, and - most importantly - how easy it is to get productive. Zero to hero in less than 30 mins - it&amp;rsquo;s really impressive.

      <title>Fair share scheduling to maximize user happiness in AWS Batch</title>

      <description>If you’re a frequent user of Batch queues, you have opinions about whether it’s scheduling is “fair” on your users.
But &amp;lsquo;fair&amp;rsquo; means different things to everyone - what’s needed are some levers and dials that allow you to figure out what ‘fair’ means for your organization.
AWS Batch now has Fair Share Scheduling, and it comes with a whole lot of controls.
We’re joined this week on Tech Shorts by Aswin Damodar from the Batch engineering team, and Christian Kniep, our Snr Dev Advocate for HPC &amp;amp; Batch, to run through all these controls and what they mean.
I’m betting this video is going to get watched a LOT. Fair-share scheduling is a complex topic, but the discussion makes it a lot easier to understand that reading the documentation probably will the first time.
