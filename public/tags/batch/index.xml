      <description>AWS Batch AWS Batch is an always-on scheduler that lets you easily and efficiently run thousands of container jobs. Workflow builders love it for scaling their workloads, from machine learning to genomics. It scales from one job to millions and takes away the chore of spinning up fleets of compute instances and keeping them busy.
Batch is a different way of running workloads compared to &amp;rsquo;normal&amp;rsquo; HPC practices you might be used to. Before you dive in on batch, it&amp;rsquo;s worth comparing it to ParallelCluster. Angel wrote a great blog post about choosing between AWS Batch or AWS ParallelCluster.
Major features you&amp;rsquo;ll want to know about Introducing fair-share scheduling for AWS Batch New console features including container insights in AWS Batch Batch can now use Fargate for a truly serverless experience AWS Batch&amp;amp;rsquo;s new Faster Scaling features Introducing support for per-job Amazon EFS volumes in AWS Batch Fair share scheduling to maximize user happiness in AWS Batch Announcements BioContainers are now available in Amazon ECR Public Gallery Workflow engines love Batch If you&amp;rsquo;re working with Nextflow natively, then you&amp;rsquo;ll probably love finding out about the AWS Genomics CLI which does pretty much all the boring set up work for you and sets you up for running Nextflow piplines in around half an hour (from a standing start).</description>

      <description>AWS service teams continuously improve the underlying infrastructure and operations of managed services, and AWS Batch is no exception. The AWS Batch team recently moved most of their job scheduler fleet to a serverless infrastructure model leveraging AWS Fargate. I had a chance to sit with Devendra Chavan, Senior Software Development Engineer on the AWS Batch team, to discuss the move to AWS Fargate and its impact on the Batch managed scheduler service component.

      <description>Ampersand is a data-driven TV advertising technology company that provides aggregated TV audience impression insights and planning on 42 million households, in every media market, across more than 165 networks and apps and in all dayparts (broadcast day segments). The Ampersand Data Science team estimated that building their statistical models would require up to 600,000 physical CPU hours to run, which would not be feasible without using a massively parallel and large-scale architecture in the cloud. AWS Batch enabled Ampersand to compress their time of computation over 500x through massive scaling while optimizing their costs using Amazon EC2 Spot. In this blog post, we will provide an overview of how Ampersand built their TV audience impressions (“impressions”) models at scale on AWS, review the architecture they have been using, and discuss optimizations they conducted to run their workload efficiently on AWS Batch.</description>

      <description>The AWS Genomics CLI (or AGC) seriously removes all the grunt work involved in setting up bioinformatics pipelines to run in the cloud. We know that Snakemake, Cromwell, NextFlow and miniWDL all work happily in the cloud on AWS Batch, but AGC means you don&amp;rsquo;t have to know to set all that stuff up - it does it for you.
You can have completely separate tool chains using completely different workflow languages all running at the same time, on the same infrastructure (if you like), sharing data and tooling.
Lee Pang from the dev team that built this came along to show us how it works, and - most importantly - how easy it is to get productive. Zero to hero in less than 30 mins - it&amp;rsquo;s really impressive.

      <description>It’s an understatement that AWS has a lot of services (more than 200 at the time of this post!). We’re usually the first to point out that there’s more than one way to solve a problem. HPC is no different in this regard, because we offer a choice: customers can run their HPC workloads using AWS […]

      <description>If you’re a frequent user of Batch queues, you have opinions about whether it’s scheduling is “fair” on your users.
But &amp;lsquo;fair&amp;rsquo; means different things to everyone - what’s needed are some levers and dials that allow you to figure out what ‘fair’ means for your organization.
AWS Batch now has Fair Share Scheduling, and it comes with a whole lot of controls.
We’re joined this week on Tech Shorts by Aswin Damodar from the Batch engineering team, and Christian Kniep, our Snr Dev Advocate for HPC &amp;amp; Batch, to run through all these controls and what they mean.
I’m betting this video is going to get watched a LOT. Fair-share scheduling is a complex topic, but the discussion makes it a lot easier to understand that reading the documentation probably will the first time.

      <description>This year, we’ve launched a lot of new capabilities for HPC customers, making AWS the best place for the length and breadth of their workflows. EFA went mainstream and is now available in sixteen instance families for fast fabric capabilities for scaling MPI and NCCL codes. We’ve written deep-dive studies to explore and explain the optimizations that will drive your workloads faster in the cloud than elsewhere. We released a major new version of AWS ParallelCluster with its own API for controlling the cluster lifecycle. AWS Batch became deeply integrated into AWS Step Functions and now supports fair-share scheduling, with multiple levers to control the experience. Today we’re signaling the arrival of a new HPC-dedicated instance family – the Hpc6a – and an enhanced EnginFrame that will bring the best of the cloud and on-premises together in a single interface.</description>

      <guid>https://d175uvn6dnkepf.cloudfront.net/post/introducing-fair-share-scheduling-for-aws-batch.html</guid>
      <description>Today we are announcing fair-share scheduling (FSS) for AWS Batch, which provides fine-grain control of the scheduling behavior by using a scheduling policy. With FSS, customers can prevent “unfair” situations caused by strict first-in, first-out scheduling where high priority jobs can’t “jump the queue” without draining other jobs first. You can now balance resource consumption between groups of workloads and have confidence that the shared compute environment is not dominated by a single workload. In this post, we’ll explain how fair-share scheduling works in more detail. You’ll also find a link to a step-by-step workshop at the end of this post, so you can try it out yourself.

      <description>Containers are rapidly maturing within the high performance computing (HPC) community and we’re excited to be part of the movement: listening to what customers have to say and feeding this back to both the community and our own product and service teams. Containerization has the potential to unblock HPC environments, so AWS ParallelCluster and container-native schedulers like AWS Batch are moving quickly to reflect the best practices developed by the community and our customers. This year is the seventh consecutive year we are hosting the ‘High Performance Container Workshop’ at ISC High Performance 2021 conference (ISC’21). The workshop will be taking place on July 2nd at 2PM CEST (7AM CST). The full program for the workshop is available on the High Performance Container Workshop page at https://hpcw.github.io/
