      <description>CryoEM is an awesome research tool, but it also comes with some challenges. The software stack is complex, and the hardware it needs is sometimes exotic and hard to get. Afterwards, there&amp;rsquo;s a massive dataset and a serious set of challenges to moving it around, and managing it. (No one wants to get stuck baby sitting someone else&amp;rsquo;s petabyte dataset unless they have to).
The team at KEK in Japan took all these challenges head on and solved them in a very different way (spoiler: it involved the cloud). But as is often the case, when teams in Japan solve a big HPC problem, it&amp;rsquo;s usually something that&amp;rsquo;s going to get picked up around the world. And KEK are very much those kinds of people.
Today is just one part in a series of Four HPC Tech Shorts dedicated to the work KEK did (yes, it&amp;rsquo;s that awesome).</description>

      <description>Amazon EC2 is the engine that powers HPC in the cloud. There&amp;rsquo;s quite a lot that&amp;rsquo;s new if you&amp;rsquo;ve never seen it before. in this Level 1 module in the Tech Shorts Foundations Series, we aim to demystify EC2 for the HPC community.
We&amp;rsquo;ll expand the number of videos in this series over time - but if there&amp;rsquo;s a topic that&amp;rsquo;s really interesting to you that we&amp;rsquo;re overlooking, don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to contact us.

      <description>We get it: AWS has too much stuff going on for any reasonably busy human to catch up with. So we&amp;rsquo;re going back to the foundations of AWS to help the HPC community come up to speed on the stuff that matters to them most.
Today we&amp;rsquo;re starting a whole new series in Tech Shorts called Tech Shorts Foundations.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start high level and gradually peel back the layers so you can get as deep as you like in the areas you&amp;rsquo;re interested in the most.
Think of this as your map to navigate AWS and get to the HPC places quickly, without having to get lost on the way there. Your journey starts here.

      <description>Spack has already been removing the ugly work from building HPC codes, but with the announcement of the Spack Binary Cache at ISC&#39;22, build and deploy times for these complicated applications will drop by 95% or more in most cases.
Greg Becker from Livermore came along to show us how it works, and discuss what&amp;rsquo;s behind it.

      <title>New file systems support in ParallelCluster 3.2 (Part 1 of 2)</title>
      <link>https://d175uvn6dnkepf.cloudfront.net/post/new-file-systems-support-in-parallelcluster-32-part-1-of-2.html</link>

      <description>ParallelCluster can now mount lots and lots of file systems that you&amp;rsquo;ve previously created in your AWS account, in addition to the scratch filesystem you can ask it to create for you when you launch your cluster. And as of today, ParallelCluster supports OpenZFS as one of those filesystems, along with Netapp ONTAP - which will help you get access to data on your enterprise filesystems, too.
Olly Perks and Austin Cherian describe all this in detail, as part 1 of a 2-part series covering the new features of ParallelCluster 3.2.

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever had to iteratively guess how much memory is left in a bunch of compute nodes in order to get your memory-hungry jobs running, then this feature will save your sanity.
It&amp;rsquo;s a new integration between ParallelCluster and Slurm that lets you specify how much RAM your jobs need, and gives Slurm the ability to figure out how to place your jobs in order to achieve that - not just counting cores, which is the default behavior for most schedulers.
Olly Perks and Austin Cherian describe this in detail, as part of a 2-part series covering the new features of ParallelCluster 3.2 (part 1 covered new file systems support and you can find it here: https://youtu.be/2JOoMv-K1FY).

      <description>In part 1, we covered all the aspects of designing and creating ParallelClusters in PCluster Manager. Today we delve into some more advanced topics like debugging your stack when something goes wrong, managing access to the cluster via the UI and CLI, and visualization, which is something that&amp;rsquo;s just super hard to do anywhere else.
Sean Smith shows us how this is all a lot easier with the right tools. if you want to install PCluster Manager in your account, head over to hpc.news/pclustermanager and deploy one of the one-click lauchable stacks to get going. There&amp;rsquo;s even an episode with Charlie (from our engineering team) showing how to install it and get it set up (it&amp;rsquo;s here: https://youtu.be/Z1vlpJYb1KQ).

      <description>Today is the first part of a 2-part series and we&amp;rsquo;re covering all the aspects of designing and creating ParallelClusters using PCluster Manager, which is a graphical user interface tool for making all the hard bits of cluster management way less messy and so much easier. All the documentation in the world isn&amp;rsquo;t as useful as this one tool.
In part 2, we&amp;rsquo;ll dive into some advanced topics like debugging your cluster build when something goes wrong, and we&amp;rsquo;ll show you some fancy access methods, and tools for managing jobs - and visualizing the results.
Sean Smith shows us how this is all a lot easier with the right tools. if you want to install PCluster Manager in your account, head over to hpc.news/pclustermanager and deploy one of the one-click lauchable stacks to get going.

      <description>Machine Learning is a huge workload, and one of the most demanding when it comes to scaling to thousands (and thousands) of CPUs. Some of the largest workloads customers run in the cloud are deep learning models, which require huge numbers of GPUs and saturate the networks connecting them.
To make all that work on AWS, NVIDIA&amp;rsquo;s collectives communications library (NCCL) relies on libfabrics to speak to the EFA hardware that makes up EC2&amp;rsquo;s high performance interconnect.
Rashika Kheria leads the team in Annapurna that handles this interface, ensuring your models, using all your favorite frameworks, scale really nicely to as far as your imagination allows (well, maybe a little further). She came to Tech Shorts to tell us how that works.

      <title>Bayesian models and half a million cores - what&#39;re you waiting for?</title>

      <description>The Ampersand Data Science team had a challenge: their Bayesian statistical models needed more than half a million core-hours of runtime, regularly, if they were to get an answer fast enough for it to be useful to their customers.
Scaling to a million core or more isn&amp;rsquo;t really a challenge now (thanks to Amazon EC2). The hard part is all the code pipelines and plumbing - and the management of the entire thing when it&amp;rsquo;s in flight.
Daniel Gerlanc (Senior Director for Data Science) and Jeffrey Enos (Senior Machine Learning Engineer) swung by the Tech Shorts virtual watercooler to tell us how it worked, what was most surprising, and which bits made all the difference.
There&amp;rsquo;s also a blog that was posted last week which talks to some of this too. Worth a read: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/hpc/bayesian-ml-models-at-scale-with-aws-batch/

      <description>The AWS Batch team recently added container insights and advanced logging features to the Batch console, which is making a LOT of people very happy.
We decided to catch up with the dev team in Seattle who worked on this, and one of my favotire Amazonians - David Chambers - joined me to help us all understand what this means to Batch users and to taker us for a drive to sere how easy it is.
This is our first ever in-person Tech Short, which is something we&amp;rsquo;re really keen to build on, now that travel is starting to happen more. Hope you like it.

      <description>This is the second part of a two-part set about the Winter Invitational Student Cluster Competition, which the AWS HPC team supported as one of four mentor teams.
This isn&amp;rsquo;t just about the competition or the results. It&amp;rsquo;s about the skills that are important to getting a job, learning new things and solving tough problems. And it&amp;rsquo;s about working together with other people.
If you&amp;rsquo;re able to support these kinds of events, you should give it a try. it&amp;rsquo;s super rewarding.

      <description>This is the first part of a two-part set about the Winter Invitational Student Cluster Competition (which the AWS HPC team supported as one of four mentor teams). The competition targeted academic institutions that we need to succeed to bring some balance to the HPC force.
Dan Olds, the Chief Research Officer of Intersect360, and the unofficial historian (and historical figure) of Student Cluster Comps, joined us to walk us through the structure of the comp, and feed us some of the drama leading up to an extraordinary result in 2022.
This isn&amp;rsquo;t just about the competition or the results. It&amp;rsquo;s about the skills that are important to getting a job, learning new things and solving tough problems while working together with other people.
If you&amp;rsquo;re able to support these kinds of events, you should give it a try. it&amp;rsquo;s super rewarding.</description>

      <description>The AWS Genomics CLI (or AGC) seriously removes all the grunt work involved in setting up bioinformatics pipelines to run in the cloud. We know that Snakemake, Cromwell, NextFlow and miniWDL all work happily in the cloud on AWS Batch, but AGC means you don&amp;rsquo;t have to know to set all that stuff up - it does it for you.
You can have completely separate tool chains using completely different workflow languages all running at the same time, on the same infrastructure (if you like), sharing data and tooling.
Lee Pang from the dev team that built this came along to show us how it works, and - most importantly - how easy it is to get productive. Zero to hero in less than 30 mins - it&amp;rsquo;s really impressive.
If you have ideas for technical topics you&amp;rsquo;d like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by finding us on Twitter (@TechHpc) and DM&amp;rsquo;ing us with your idea.</description>

      <description>Swaine Chen had a problem: his new group at the Genomics Institute of Singapore needed common tooling involving zillions of utilities, scripts carrying algorithms and techniques, so they could migrate their workloads from their on-premises infrastructure and over to the cloud.
His solution was to build a golden AMI. So much better is that he automated the production of the AMI, and documented it in GitHub, for the world to see, and for the world to use.
Today&amp;rsquo;s discussion shows just a glimpse of what his team has built, and you can get all the goodness in the hands-on training workshops he&amp;rsquo;s offering (for free) to anyone in the world who wants to sign up.
If you want to know more about the workshops, or sign up, go here: https://hpc.news/giswsregister
If you want to plunder all this goodness and use it for the forces of good (not evil!</description>

      <description>In recent years, we’ve all been amazed at how large areas of scientific computing have moved to abstract their workflows away from the details of systems and cluster architecture. Bioinformatics has really lead the way in this regard - exploiting the fact that they came to large scale computing without decades of legacy code.
Nextflow is an open source project that has been hugely impactful in that movement, enabling a community leverage each other&amp;rsquo;s scientific work and - honestly - stand on each others&amp;rsquo; shoulders to reach further. We didn&amp;rsquo;t need a pandemic to drive that point home, but they played their part there too (more on that in a later show).
Today we’re joined by Evan Floden, who is a principle author of Nextflow (along with other leaders like Paolo Di Tommaso who was one of Nextflow’s creators). Evan is also the CEO of Seqera Labs, the company he and Paolo formed to provide extra support to Nextflow users, and to take management of the workflows and integration with the underlying infrastructure to a whole new level.</description>
