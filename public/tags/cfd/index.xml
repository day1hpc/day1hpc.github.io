      <description>Sometimes when we&amp;rsquo;re looking for performance we lose the forrest for all those trees - we miss the huge improvements we can do to unglamorous parts of the overall workflow, while we obsess on the pieces that look hard. It&amp;rsquo;s an engineer thing, I think.
In today&amp;rsquo;s Tech Short, Neil Ashton shows us exactly this kind of example from the world of CFD (using OpenFOAM, but this lesson applies generally) - and shows us how to break the problem down in order to speed it all up - and pretty easily, too.
The workshops we reference in the discussion are all listed here: https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/cfd/

      <description>Today we launched the new Amazon EC2 C6i instance family which is powered by the Intel Xeon Ice Lake processor and comes equipped with our Elastic Fabric Adapter.
Neil Ashton and Nicola Venuti joined us to talk about CFD performance on this new instance family, and spent some time comparing network connectivity options, too.
This is a two part series of Tech Shorts:
Part 1) Discuss C6i and how it&amp;rsquo;s put together. Look at OpenFOAM and Siemens Simcenter StarCCM+ Part 2) Ansys Fluent, under populated cores, and some on-premises comparisons for calibration.

      <description>Each week weâ€™re going to take you to the water cooler here in AWS to talk to engineers and architects about the technology, tools and techniques that make AWS the best place to run your HPC workloads in the cloud.
