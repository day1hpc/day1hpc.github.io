      <description>EnginFrame makes life easy for scientists and engineers so they can use HPC resources without having to understand the complexity.
BUT: EnginFrame also makes the local sysadmin a hero by giving them the ability to embed into simple scripts the decisions that lead to determining how and where and when a job gets run.
The use cases are almost endless:
decide whether your job bursts to the cloud based on congestion conditions in your on&amp;ndash;prem queues figure out if data needs to be moved first before a job can be run decide based on job parameters whether a job is fit for execution in the AWS spot market, or should be run on-prem, or run in on-demand queues. The workshop we discussed is here: https://hpc.news/efConnectorWorkshop

      <title>Genomics workflow set made easy with AWS Genomics CLI</title>

      <description>The AWS Genomics CLI (or AGC) seriously removes all the grunt work involved in setting up bioinformatics pipelines to run in the cloud. We know that Snakemake, Cromwell, NextFlow and miniWDL all work happily in the cloud on AWS Batch, but AGC means you don&amp;rsquo;t have to know to set all that stuff up - it does it for you.
You can have completely separate tool chains using completely different workflow languages all running at the same time, on the same infrastructure (if you like), sharing data and tooling.
Lee Pang from the dev team that built this came along to show us how it works, and - most importantly - how easy it is to get productive. Zero to hero in less than 30 mins - it&amp;rsquo;s really impressive.

      <title>A new GUI for building and managing clusters - PCluster Manager</title>

      <description>Charlie Gruenweld, our newest Principal Engineer in the HPC org, took advantage of the new API in ParallelCluster and a few dozen years of web development revolutions to build a snappy UI for creating and managing clusters that makes it nearly impossible to go wrong - and gives you immediate access to some of ParallelCluster&amp;rsquo;s most powerful features.
In less than 20 minutes, you&amp;rsquo;ll grok how to create a cluster, run jobs, spawn elastic (disposable) nodes, and jump into a full graphical desktop to run visual applications on the cluster itself.
This is the project that brings it all together. I hope you enjoy this as much as I did.
