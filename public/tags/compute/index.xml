      <description>AWS ParallelCluster version 3.2 now supports memory-aware scheduling in Slurm to give you control over the placement of jobs with specific memory requirements. In this blog post, we’ll show you how it works, and explain why this will be really useful to people with memory-hungry workloads.

      <description>High Performance Computing (HPC) is known as a domain where applications are well-optimized to get the highest performance possible on a platform. Unsurprisingly, a common question when moving a workload to AWS is what performance difference there may be from an existing on-premises “bare metal” platform. This blog will show the performance differential between “bare metal” instances and instances that use the AWS Nitro hypervisor is negligible for the evaluated HPC workloads.

      <description>This post is written by Deepak Singh, Vice President of Compute Services. At AWS, we love working with customers to solve their toughest challenges. High performance computing (HPC) is one of those challenges that pushes against the boundaries of AWS performance at scale. HPC is also a personal interest of mine, as I came to […]
