      <description>Charlie Gruenweld, our newest Principal Engineer in the HPC org, took advantage of the new API in ParallelCluster and a few dozen years of web development revolutions to build a snappy UI for creating and managing clusters that makes it nearly impossible to go wrong - and gives you immediate access to some of ParallelCluster&amp;rsquo;s most powerful features.
In less than 20 minutes, you&amp;rsquo;ll grok how to create a cluster, run jobs, spawn elastic (disposable) nodes, and jump into a full graphical desktop to run visual applications on the cluster itself.
This is the project that brings it all together. I hope you enjoy this as much as I did.
If you have ideas for technical topics you&amp;rsquo;d like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by finding us on Twitter (@TechHpc) and DM&amp;rsquo;ing us with your idea.</description>
