      <description>Customers have been asking us to make it easy to configure ParallelCluster to use a corporate directory server, so adding a user to the cloud HPC stack becomes as easy as adding them to (say) the Engineering Group in Active Directory or LDAP.
We&amp;rsquo;re happy to say we&amp;rsquo;ve done that, and released a blog about it a couple weeks ago. In today&amp;rsquo;s show, Giacomo Marciani (one of the developers who built this feature) came along to explain how it works and give us a demo, so you can get to the important steps fast.
During the show we spoke about a blog and a tutorial. They&amp;rsquo; right here:
