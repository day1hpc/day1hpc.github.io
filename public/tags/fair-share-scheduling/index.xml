      <description>If you’re a frequent user of Batch queues, you have opinions about whether it’s scheduling is “fair” on your users.
But &amp;lsquo;fair&amp;rsquo; means different things to everyone - what’s needed are some levers and dials that allow you to figure out what ‘fair’ means for your organization.
AWS Batch now has Fair Share Scheduling, and it comes with a whole lot of controls.
We’re joined this week on Tech Shorts by Aswin Damodar from the Batch engineering team, and Christian Kniep, our Snr Dev Advocate for HPC &amp;amp; Batch, to run through all these controls and what they mean.
I’m betting this video is going to get watched a LOT. Fair-share scheduling is a complex topic, but the discussion makes it a lot easier to understand that reading the documentation probably will the first time.
If you have ideas for technical topics you&amp;rsquo;d like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by finding us on Twitter (@TechHpc) and DM&amp;rsquo;ing us with your idea.</description>
