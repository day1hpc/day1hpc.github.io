      <description>Since our NICE DCV high performance desktop and application streaming product does such a great job of making it feel like you have a cloud dat center sitting behind your laptop screen somewhere, lots of customers have asked &amp;lsquo;Won&amp;rsquo;t that impact my bill? You guys charge for data, right?&amp;rsquo;.
There&amp;rsquo;s no way to give a precise answer, but what we did do was to put together a range of usage scenarios from fairly pedestrian usage (doing work processing on a remote windows machine) through to high bit-rate gaming and video streaming. We tested them all and measured their consumption. And we show you the results. Bottom line: data charges are&amp;rsquo;t really going to nudge your billing by much unless you&amp;rsquo;re getting close to 4K video streaming.
Jyothi Venkatesh and Boof put DCV to the test, and we walk you through the scenarios and our analysis.</description>
