      <description>Carsten Kutzner is a researcher and scientific software developer at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Göttingen in Germany. He&amp;rsquo;s been doing some really diverse benchmarking studies in collaboration with our HPC engineering team, and he joins us today to talk about some of the results of that investigation.
What&amp;rsquo;s most interesting (and soft of unexpected) is the instances he concludes are the best for the job - whether you&amp;rsquo;re optimizing for sheer performance against the clock, or price performance because you need to maximize your budget within a more generous time window. No spoilers here: you need to hear him talk.
Molecular Dynamicists are used to doing these calculations because they measure their progress in nanoseconds of simulation time per DAY of wall clock time. As Carsten points out: if your job runs for days or weeks, it matters whether you can squeeze 10% more from the compute units it&amp;rsquo;s running on.</description>

      <description>We just published a blog post last week with a deep dive into what makes GROMACS tick. The blog post talked about software stacks and EC2 instances that will deliver the best possible performance for people trying to do some molecular dynamics quickly. This turns out to be pretty much EVERYONE in the MD community, because these are people who measure their progress in nanoseconds of simulation PER DAY of wall clock time.
Austin Cherian is one of our senior engineers in the Developer Relations team, and the one who is the most obsessed with performance and getting the performance testing methodology right. We asked him to join tech shorts this week to show us how he uses and abuses AWS ParallelCluster in his quest of “making stuff go fast”, because his use cases are pretty common, and might help you imagine some better ways of working.</description>
