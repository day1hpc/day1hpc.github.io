      <description>EnginFrame makes life easy for scientists and engineers so they can use HPC resources without having to understand the complexity.
BUT: EnginFrame also makes the local sysadmin a hero by giving them the ability to embed into simple scripts the decisions that lead to determining how and where and when a job gets run.
The use cases are almost endless:
decide whether your job bursts to the cloud based on congestion conditions in your on&amp;ndash;prem queues figure out if data needs to be moved first before a job can be run decide based on job parameters whether a job is fit for execution in the AWS spot market, or should be run on-prem, or run in on-demand queues. The workshop we discussed is here: https://hpc.news/efConnectorWorkshop
