      <description>As part of the launch of ParallelCluster 3, we want to make it easy to migrate all your workflows from to Slurm, but we know that it can seem daunting. So we enlisted the help of SchedMD&amp;rsquo;s Director of Cloud Engineering, Nick Ihli to help us show you how it&amp;rsquo;s a lot easier than it might look.
(Seriously, you may need to change very little).
Over the next 5 x Tech Shorts we&amp;rsquo;ll show:
Part 1) Command line syntax and which Slurm commands map to familiar SGE ones. Part 2) Job Scripts - what&amp;rsquo;s the stuff you need to care about to adjust ytour scripts? What&amp;rsquo;s actually easier with Slurm? Part 3) Array Jobs - Slurm has a really elegant way to handle array jobs, and also has some really nice SGE-like commands that will fool you into thinking nothing actually changed.</description>
