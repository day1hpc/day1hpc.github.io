      <description>The AWS Genomics CLI (or AGC) seriously removes all the grunt work involved in setting up bioinformatics pipelines to run in the cloud. We know that Snakemake, Cromwell, NextFlow and miniWDL all work happily in the cloud on AWS Batch, but AGC means you don&amp;rsquo;t have to know to set all that stuff up - it does it for you.
You can have completely separate tool chains using completely different workflow languages all running at the same time, on the same infrastructure (if you like), sharing data and tooling.
Lee Pang from the dev team that built this came along to show us how it works, and - most importantly - how easy it is to get productive. Zero to hero in less than 30 mins - it&amp;rsquo;s really impressive.

      <title>miniWDL workflows with 100% cloud elasticity, and no DevOps geekery</title>

      <description>Mike Lin is the creator and maintainer of miniWDL and has been working with our Genomics and ML teams to integrate it with Sagemaker Studio and AWS Batch. The result is a working environment that&amp;rsquo;s completely familiar and easy to use (it&amp;rsquo;s Jupyter, after all) and yet has access to all the elasticity of the cloud, but without ever needing to leave the familiar notebook interface to make that magic happen.
It&amp;rsquo;s a really cool example of bringing the tools to science, rather than forcing the scientists to understand yet another new tool.
