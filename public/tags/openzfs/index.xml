      <description>ParallelCluster can now mount lots and lots of file systems that you&amp;rsquo;ve previously created in your AWS account, in addition to the scratch filesystem you can ask it to create for you when you launch your cluster. And as of today, ParallelCluster supports OpenZFS as one of those filesystems, along with Netapp ONTAP - which will help you get access to data on your enterprise filesystems, too.
Olly Perks and Austin Cherian describe all this in detail, as part 1 of a 2-part series covering the new features of ParallelCluster 3.2.

      <description>We launched Amazon FSx for OpenZFS at re:invent in December, and well let&amp;rsquo;s just say it&amp;rsquo;s been more than a bit popular :-)
ZFS and it&amp;rsquo;s friends have been a long time favorite of the HPC community, so we asked Delwin Olivan, the Snr Product Manager for the service to come and show us how easy it is to get big scale, and big performance with very little effort.
Auto-backups and one-click snapshots are exactly as they&amp;rsquo;re described on the lid. Which is awesome.
