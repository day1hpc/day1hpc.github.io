      <description>In December, we introduced EnginFrame with AWS HPC Connector, which is a new feature in EnginFrame to help customers leverage managed HPC resources in AWS as well as their on-prem systems - that means a single interface so administrators can make easy to use workflows available no matter where they live.
It means highly specialized users like scientists and engineers can use EnginFrameâ€™s portal interface to run their important workflows without having to understand the detailed operation of infrastructure underneath. HPC is, after all, a tool used by humans. Their productivity is the real measure of success, and we think AWS HPC Connector will make a big difference to them.
In this talk, Fabrizio Chignoli (who leads the EnginFrame dev team) shows us how it all works and what the end user experience looks like.
If you have ideas for technical topics you&amp;rsquo;d like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by finding us on Twitter (@TechHpc) and DM&amp;rsquo;ing us with your idea.</description>
