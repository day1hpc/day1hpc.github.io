      <description>AWS ParallelCluster ParallelCluster is a tool for creating and managing HPC clusters on AWS, whether they&amp;rsquo;re powered by x86 CPUs, AWS Gravitons (our Arm-based processors), or powerful GPUs for machine-learning applications.
ParallelCluster brings together advanced compute, storage and networking into a single console. It adds great features like desktop visualization (with NICE DCV) for any cluster, and integrates deeply with Slurm to provide cloud-native scaling for all your applications.
ParallelCluster has a graphical interface (and a CLI) to model and control all the resources you need for your HPC applications, and an API you can use for sophisticated management of workflows.
Deployment There are two ways to get ParallelCluster::
We suggest using PCluster Manager, which is a visual interface for designing and deploying your clusters. PCluster Manager has great features that help you integrate fast filesytems (like Lustre), get one-click desktops connections using NICE DCV, and controlling your spend using Slurm Accounting.</description>
