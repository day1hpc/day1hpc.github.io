      <description>HPC in Financial Services is interesting for a lot of reasons that have nothing to do with banking. It&amp;rsquo;s an embarrassingly parallel workload, typically made up from zillions of short&amp;rsquo;ish jobs (seconds to minutes). And the decisions it supports are pretty big ones: whole banks and entire economies might be impacted by the outcomes. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting because there are so many fun ways you can solve the problem of &amp;lsquo;get it done fast, cheaply, and soon enough to help the people who are making really big decisions&amp;rsquo;. And whilst you expect us to say this: the cloud truly is a real game changer for this workload.
