      <description>Charlie Gruenweld, our newest Principal Engineer in the HPC org, took advantage of the new API in ParallelCluster and a few dozen years of web development revolutions to build a snappy UI for creating and managing clusters that makes it nearly impossible to go wrong - and gives you immediate access to some of ParallelCluster&amp;rsquo;s most powerful features.
In less than 20 minutes, you&amp;rsquo;ll grok how to create a cluster, run jobs, spawn elastic (disposable) nodes, and jump into a full graphical desktop to run visual applications on the cluster itself.
This is the project that brings it all together. I hope you enjoy this as much as I did.
If you have ideas for technical topics you&amp;rsquo;d like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by finding us on Twitter (@TechHpc) and DM&amp;rsquo;ing us with your idea.</description>

      <title>Getting started with bioinformatics on AWS with Swaine Chen from GIS</title>

      <description>Swaine Chen had a problem: his new group at the Genomics Institute of Singapore needed common tooling involving zillions of utilities, scripts carrying algorithms and techniques, so they could migrate their workloads from their on-premises infrastructure and over to the cloud.
His solution was to build a golden AMI. So much better is that he automated the production of the AMI, and documented it in GitHub, for the world to see, and for the world to use.
Today&amp;rsquo;s discussion shows just a glimpse of what his team has built, and you can get all the goodness in the hands-on training workshops he&amp;rsquo;s offering (for free) to anyone in the world who wants to sign up.
If you want to know more about the workshops, or sign up, go here: https://hpc.news/giswsregister
If you want to plunder all this goodness and use it for the forces of good (not evil!</description>

      <description>In recent years, we’ve all been amazed at how large areas of scientific computing have moved to abstract their workflows away from the details of systems and cluster architecture. Bioinformatics has really lead the way in this regard - exploiting the fact that they came to large scale computing without decades of legacy code.
Nextflow is an open source project that has been hugely impactful in that movement, enabling a community leverage each other&amp;rsquo;s scientific work and - honestly - stand on each others&amp;rsquo; shoulders to reach further. We didn&amp;rsquo;t need a pandemic to drive that point home, but they played their part there too (more on that in a later show).
Today we’re joined by Evan Floden, who is a principle author of Nextflow (along with other leaders like Paolo Di Tommaso who was one of Nextflow’s creators). Evan is also the CEO of Seqera Labs, the company he and Paolo formed to provide extra support to Nextflow users, and to take management of the workflows and integration with the underlying infrastructure to a whole new level.</description>
