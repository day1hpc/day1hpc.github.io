      <description>Nextflow Tower became necessary when lots of Nextflow users started to leave the confines of their existing environments in search of more compute, more storage, more capabilities. Nextflow made their workflows portable, but there was still a lot of relatively complex work to be done standing up cloud infrastructure, setting limits, choosing instances, pondering VPCs, Batch compute environments &amp;hellip; You get the idea.
Nextflow Tower massively simplifies that. It integrates deeply with all these environments (lots of clouds, lots of cluster types, and even in hybrid mode) such that a researcher with a good idea can go from laptop to server to cluster to massive compute farm, step-by-step as their idea and ambition grows.
Evan Floden, the CEO of Seqera Labs and a core developer of Nextflow (along with his friend and business partner Paolo Di Tommaso) steps in to take us for a drive of Tower and explains some of the tech underpinning it.</description>

      <title>NF Core is an example to all compute-intensive scientific fields. They should all watch this.</title>

      <description>NF Core is an open source repository of Nextflow workflows that can be downloaded, shared, forked, updated, tested and validated. If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever heard that quote from Isaac Newtown about seeing further by standing on the shoulders of giants: well this is the ladder modern day scientists are using to climb up those very big shoulders. Phil Ewels from the SciLife lab at Stockholm University walks us through some of the history of NF Core and gives us a demo of how easy it is to use, and the cool tools he and his project team have built around to just make it &amp;hellip; a no brainer. Every domain of science should be looking at how this works, because every field of science performs a workflow on data - and those workflows are getting increasingly complicated. If you have ideas for technical topics you&amp;rsquo;d like to see us cover in a future show, let us know by finding us on Twitter (@TechHpc) and DM&amp;rsquo;ing us with your idea.</description>
