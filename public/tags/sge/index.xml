      <description>Slurm&amp;rsquo;s job management API, coupled with ParallelCluster&amp;rsquo;s own API for managing cluster infrastructure opens up a lot of doors to create new ways for your users to interact with HPC resources - in this case without having to leave their familiar Jupyter notebook environment.
We made this video as part of the launch of ParallelCluster 3 - we want to make it easy to migrate all your workflows from to Slurm, and we figured it would be easier if you heard abotu it from the source.
So we enlisted the help of SchedMD&amp;rsquo;s Director of Cloud Engineering, Nick Ihli to help us show you how it&amp;rsquo;s a lot easier than it might look.
Joining Nick today is Josiah Bjorgaard from the AWS APN Solution Architecture team, who regularly works with Nick and the team from SchedMD to solve lots of customer problems.</description>

So we enlisted the help of SchedMD&amp;rsquo;s Director of Cloud Engineering, Nick Ihli to help us show you how it&amp;rsquo;s a lot easier than it might look.
(Seriously, you may need to change very little).
Over the next 5 x Tech Shorts we&amp;rsquo;ll show:
Part 1) Command line syntax and which Slurm commands map to familiar SGE ones. Part 2) Job Scripts - what&amp;rsquo;s the stuff you need to care about to adjust ytour scripts? What&amp;rsquo;s actually easier with Slurm? Part 3) Array Jobs - Slurm has a really elegant way to handle array jobs, and also has some really nice SGE-like commands that will fool you into thinking nothing actually changed.</description>
