      <description>Spack has already been removing the ugly work from building HPC codes, but with the announcement of the Spack Binary Cache at ISC&#39;22, build and deploy times for these complicated applications will drop by 95% or more in most cases.
Greg Becker from Livermore came along to show us how it works, and discuss what&amp;rsquo;s behind it.
You can find a blog post about the announcement here: hpc.news/binaryCache

      <description>This is a talk that was delivered at the AWS/Arm Cloud Hackathon in July 2021.
Todd Gamblin (the creator of Spack) and his colleague Greg Becker talk us through the essential skills and concepts needed to understand how to create and deploy Spack recipes to build scientific codes. Spack massively simplifies the task of building scientific applications, which are almost defined by their insane build methods and dependency hierarchies. We made extensive use of Spack in the hackathon, and were extremely grateful for their help.
The Summer Hackathon ran for a week from July 12-16 in 2021. It&amp;rsquo;s purpose was to assemble the HPC community around a common goal of beginning the porting/testing/tuning process for dozens of codes to use Arm-based processors, in this case, AWS&amp;rsquo;s Graviton2&amp;rsquo;s.
During the week we had a series of talks from global leaders and experts in various fields from compilers to networking, profiling debugging and tooling.</description>
