      <description>The AWS Graviton 3 will be launched this year as part of the new C7g instance. Inside this chip are some interesting innovations that already have a lot of HPC and AI/ML customers interested.
We sat down with Olly Perks, who recently joined AWS HPC Engineering from Arm, to discuss what&amp;rsquo;s most interesting. This is the first of a series of Tech Shorts covering the Graviton 3 architecture. We&amp;rsquo;ll deep dive on techniques and tools for getting the most out of these CPUs.

      <description>reInvent &amp;lsquo;21 is over, but it was a busy week with new tech developments we&amp;rsquo;ve built for customers in pretty much every area of HPC: storage, networking and compute.
We talk with our HPC General Manager, Ian Colle, about ZFS, Lustre, Graviton3, DDR5, EFA at 400 Gb/s on dozens of instances &amp;hellip; and a lot more.
If you didn&amp;rsquo;t get to reinvent, or even if you did and couldn&amp;rsquo;t be in 10 places at once, this is a compact recap for you.
