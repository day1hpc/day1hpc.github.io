      <description>NICE DCV NICE DCV is a high performance, low latency pixel streaming protocol that encrypts and transports pixels to devices, putting your desktop closer to your results. You can access, manipulate, and share business-critical information, regardless of your location, over local networks or the internet.
DCV makes very frugal use of scarce bandwidth, because it&amp;rsquo;s super-lean, uses data-compression techniques and has always quickly adopted cutting-edge technologies (this is HPC, after all, we leave nothing on the table when it came to exploiting new gadgets).
A desktop &amp;hellip; in a web browser? DCV also has a Web SDK which means you can offer your end users virtual desktops embedded in browser tabs (check out the talk from Netflix about how they did just that for their global network of editors).
All of this is what makes DCV a light-weight visualization package that can stream pixels over almost any network.</description>
