AWS-THEATRE,T,,,Cooking up advanced HPC with community recipes,"HPC systems deployed on AWS often rely on various resources like file systems, networking, and directory services. Despite AWS ParallelCluster’s automation capabilities, setting up and integrating these dependencies can become complex if you have a lot of custom requirements. In this session, walk through how the new HPC Recipes for AWS library simplifies this process. Then, learn how to create a multi-user environment, configure shared storage, set up a budget, and deploy a benchmarking cluster with just a few clicks in the AWS Management Console. Finally, discover how to combine, modify, and reuse these recipes to meet your particular needs—without needing to be an AWS expert.",AWS,13-Nov,20:00,21:00,Monday,bouffler,"Matt Vaughn, Principal HPC Developer Advocate, AWS; Brian Skjerven, Senior UK/IR HPC Specialist Solutions Architect, AWS",,Cooking up advanced HPC with community recipes,AWS Booth #1001 | Theatre @ SC'23 Denver,"ParallelCluster, Storage, Batch",,,,,,
